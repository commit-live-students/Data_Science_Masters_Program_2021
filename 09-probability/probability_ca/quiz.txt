6. Suppose you were interviewed for a data science role. 60% of the people who sat for the first interview received the call for second interview. 80% of the people who got a call for second interview felt good about their first interview. 70% of people who did not receive a second call, also felt good about their first interview. If you felt good after your first interview, what is the probability that you will receive a second interview call?

b.60%
c.66%
d.54%


Ans: 60%





7. Events A and B are independent if and only if

a. P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)
b. P(A | B) = P(A) P(B | A)
c. P(B | A) = P(A) P(B | A)

8. You are planning to play cricket today, but the morning is cloudy, 50% of all rainy days start off cloudy! But cloudy mornings are common about 40% of days start cloudy and this is usually a dry month only 10% tend to be rainy, what is the chance of rain during the day?

a. 0.215
b. 0.1556
c. 0.132
d. 0.125

Ans: 0.125






P(Rain) is Probability of Rain = 10%
P(Cloud|Rain) is Probability of Cloud, given that Rain happens = 50%
P(Cloud) is Probability of Cloud = 40%
P(Rain|Cloud) =  0.1 x 0.50.4   = .125

a. independent
b. dependent


Ans: independent
