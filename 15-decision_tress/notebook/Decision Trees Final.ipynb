    "The problem that we will solve is related to the banking sector. A bank has put out a marketing campaign and wants to know how the campaign is working. Given the features of the client and the marketing campaign, we have to predict whether the customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not. This is a classification problem, which we will now try to solve using decision trees. The original dataset has 17 features and around 11000 data points. To get a deeper understanding of the problem, you can read more about the problem [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a175/aeb08734fd669beaffd3d185a424a6f03b84.pdf). \n",

    "- Learn about overfitting in decision tree and how it can be prevented. \n",

    "### 3.2 Interpreting decision tree built in sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us again look at the tree created on the toy dataset. Now, that we have built sufficient intuition on how the tree is built, how to choose the attribute on which to split the tree - let us understand the tree better and learn how to use the tree :) . \n",
    "\n",
    "![toy_dec_tree](../images/dec_tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At each level, we have the following information :-\n",
    "1. the condition of the split at the particular node. \n",
    "2. entropy - the entropy of the data before the split\n",
    "3. samples - the number of samples of data before the split (at that node)\n",
    "4. value - the classwise distribution of the samples\n",
    "5. class - the class decision for any element at that node. (if you were to assign a class label to a data point at that node, what label to assign.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicting on new data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run through an unseen new data point through a decision tree. We will visually see how we decide the class membership of a sample test point - [54,337,2,1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "![dec_tree_run](../images/small_decision_tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explaination**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps explain how the decision tree makes predictions:\n",
    "- Primary splitting feature is `age` and its threshold is `39`. The age is `54` (greater than threshold) and so we go to the next node\n",
    "- This time the splitting feature is `balance` with threshold `717`. Our new point has `balance` equal to `337` and so we go to the left node below\n",
    "- Again the splitting feature is `balance` with threshold `211`. We know that data point has `337` as `balance` which leads to a node with pure split (right node in orange). It has class label of `0` which is our prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Importance in Decision Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of decision tree is that you can look at the importance of features. Lets look how to achieve it with python's scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import packages\n",
    "from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "# initialize decision tree\n",
    "tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# fit on data\n",
    "tree.fit(toy_data, toy_label)\n",
    "\n",
    "# feature importances \n",
    "print(\"Feature importances are:\", dict(zip(toy_data.columns, np.round(tree.feature_importances_,3))))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Feature importances are: {'age': 0.459, 'balance': 0.398, 'campaign': 0.143, 'housing_cat': 0.0}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the output, we can infer that `balance` is the most important feature and `housing_cat` is the least"

    "\n",
    "1) Easy to Understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree output is very easy to understand even for people from non-analytical background.\n",
    "- It does not require any statistical knowledge to read and interpret them.\n",
    "- Its graphical representation is very intuitive and users can easily relate their hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Useful in Data exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables. - With the help of decision trees, we can create new variables / features that has better power to predict target variable. - It can also be used in data exploration stage. For example, we are working on a problem where we have information available in hundreds of variables, there decision tree will help to identify most significant variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Less data cleaning required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It requires less data cleaning compared to some other modeling techniques.\n",
    "- It is not influenced by outliers and missing values to a fair degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Data type is not a constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can handle both numerical and categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Non Parametric Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree is considered to be a non-parametric method.\n",
    "- This means that decision trees have no assumptions about the space distribution and the classifier structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks of decision trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree."
