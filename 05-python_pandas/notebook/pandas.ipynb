    "\n",
    "An important step for any data scientist is to prepare and clean the data so that it could be used later for deeper analysis. Analysis on raw and unclean data could lead to wrong insights which could derail the organization. Real 'raw' data needs a lot of 'wrangling' operations before it can be ready for dissection by a data scientist. One of the popular tools for data wrangling in python is `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons why Python is used extensively for Data Science is the availability of widespread packages for almost every possible function. The library `pandas` is one such package which makes life easier especially for data analysis through its extensive in-built functions for manipulations and visualizations. It is built on top of the `NumPy` and `matplotlib` library and one can harness the power of both these libraries in tandem with the power of `pandas`. Besides, there is huge community support especially for `pandas` and there are very high chances that you will get an answer for your query (if and when you get stuck) on the Internet. Take a look at the trend below to realize its popularity amongst users.\n",

    "A Series is a single vector of data (like a `NumPy` array) with an **index** that labels each element in the vector. **The main difference between a series and NumPy array is that series may have axis labels, a NumPy array doesn't**.  A `NumPy` array comprises the values of the series, while the index is a pandas `Index` object. It can hold any type of data (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.) as long as the data is homogeneous throughout the series. If an index is not specified, a default sequence of integers is assigned as the index.\n",

Most often they are undesirable and you can replace them with any value you want with the help of `.fillna()` method of pandas. Lets say you want to replace **NaN**s with value `a`; simply use `series.fillna(a)` and additionaly if you want the change to be permanent use `inplace=True` inside `.fillna()` method.   \n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploring further into the data, you need to learn how to create, select and delete values according to rows and columns. Let us look at some example to understand how it works. All of the examples have been performed on the Pokemon dataset only.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Column operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Selection**: If you have a DataFrame `df` and you want to select a column `col1` you can do it by `df[col1]`; if you have multiple columns `col1`, `col2`, `col3` you do it by `df[[col1, col2, col3]]`  \n",
    "  <img align=\"center\" src=\"../images/columns_1.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"100\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the column `Name` is selected and if you care to check its type, it is a **Series** object. \n",
    "\n",
    "  <img align=\"center\" src=\"../images/columns_2.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"100\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the columns `Name`, `HP` and `Attack` are selected \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Creation**: Now, you want to make a new column `Difference` which is the difference between `Attack` and `Defense` column for every Pokemon. How to do it? Its actually quite simple. As you already know every column is basically a pandas series object which is again a NumPy series. Provided the data types of the series match, you can add the values by a $+$ operator. In this case also, you will do the same and the syntax is: `df[new_column] = df[col1] + df[col2]` (You can also perform subtraction, division etc.)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <img align=\"center\" src=\"../images/columns_3.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"100\" />\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Deletion**: Now you want to delete the column `Difference` that you had just made. You can do it by `df.drop([col1, col2, ...], inplace=True, axis=0/1)`. Note that **inplace=True** deletes columns from the dataframe permanently and axis specifies whether to drop across columns (axis=$1$) or rows (axis=$0$) \n",
    "   \n",
    "   <img align=\"center\" src=\"../images/columns_4.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"100\" />\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) **Row operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Selection**: You can access rows by either label of index using `loc` or integer (row number) using `iloc` keyword. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Syntax using **`loc`**: `df.loc[index]`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Syntax using **`iloc`**: `df.iloc[row number]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| iloc | loc |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| <img align = \"left\" src=\"../images/iloc.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"100\" /> | <img src=\"../images/loc.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"100\" /> |\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In the images above both of them point to the same row; the first row can be accessed via `iloc[0]` and via `loc[299]` since it has index of $299$. Their output is also the same and it is:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <img align=\"centre\" src=\"../images/result.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"100\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Slicing**: Use `df[start:end]` to slice rows according to **row number (not label)**; here end value is not inclusive. Heres how you can slice from row numbers $2$ and $3$: `df[2:4]`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Creation/Addition**:  Use `df.append(data)` where `data` is a DataFrame or Series/dictionary-like object, or list of these. In our Pokemon dataset, you want to add another Pokemon whose `#` value is $800$ and rest of its attributes are all $0$. Lets look at how you can add this new instance:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <img align=\"left\" src=\"../images/add_row.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"300\" />\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Observe the last row. This is the one that we had created**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Deletion**: You can delete rows using the `.drop()` to drop rows by specifying **axis=0** inside the function. Also, you have the liberty to drop either by label or by position. In the example of addition of rows, observe that the new instance has an index label of $0$. Lets delete it permanently.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <img align=\"center\" src=\"../images/delete_row.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now lets check whether this row was actually deleted; we already know that its index was $0$, so we will check its presence in the list of indices which are available in `df.index`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <img align=\"center\" src=\"../images/check1.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />\n",

Also, the `#` attribute doesn't seem to convey any type of information other than the fact that it is unique for every pokemon. So, the `Name` attribute is enough for describing and also it is convenient to call pokemons by their names rather than their ids. \n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do we mean by merging of dataframes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever worked with databases you must be familiar with the concept of **merge** and **join** operations. The same behaviour in pandas can be achieved with the help of `pandas.merge()` and also the `pandas.join()` methods. **Merging** two or more datasets is the process of bringing them together into one, and aligning the rows from each based on common attributes or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid using for loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `for` loops you can also achieve the same outcome; but it is not advisable as it results in more verbose code which runs slowly as compared to the `.merge()` and `.join()` functionalities provided by `pandas` module.\n",
    "So, if you ever come across such a situation, avoid using loops and isntead use the functionalities provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax of merge**\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is `pd.merge(left, right, how='inner', on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None,\n",
    "left_index=False, right_index=False, sort=True)` where:\n",
    "- `left`: dataframe\n",
    "- `right`: dataframe\n",
    "- `on`: Columns (names) to join on. Must be found in both the left and right DataFrame objects.\n",
    "- `left_on`: Columns from the `left` DataFrame to use as keys (can either be column names or arrays with length equal to the length of the DataFrame).\n",
    "- `right_on`: Columns from the `right` DataFrame to use as keys (can either be column names or arrays with length equal to the length of the DataFrame).\n",
    "- `left_index`: If True, use the index (row labels) from the `left` DataFrame as its join key(s). In case of a DataFrame with a MultiIndex (hierarchical), the number of levels must match the number of join keys from the `right` DataFrame.\n",
    "- `right_index`: Same usage as `left_index` for the `right` DataFrame.\n",
    "- `how` − One of 'left', 'right', 'outer', 'inner'. Defaults to 'inner'\n",
    "- `sort` − Sort the result DataFrame by the join keys in lexicographical order. Defaults to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember that while using merge you should always specify the columns where to merge on (specified by the `on` argument inside `.merge()`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joins in dataframes\n",
    " \n",
    "By default `pandas` merge function joins dataframes by inner join. An inner merge, (or inner join) keeps only the common values in both the left and right dataframes for the result. However, there are other types of joins or merge also possible with `pandas` module. Lets discuss them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inner Merge / Inner join:** The default `pandas` behaviour; only keep rows where the merge **on** value exists in both the left and right dataframes.\n",
    "2. **Left Merge / Left outer join(aka left merge or left join):** Keep every row in the `left` dataframe; where there are missing values of the **on** variable in the `right` dataframe, add empty / NaN values in the result.\n",
    "3. **Right Merge / Right outer join(aka right merge or right join):** Keep every row in the `right` dataframe; where there are missing values of the **on** variable in the `left` column, add empty / NaN values in the result.\n",
    "4. **Outer Merge / Full outer join** – A full outer join returns all the rows from the `left` dataframe, all the rows from the `right` dataframe, and matches up rows where possible, with NaNs elsewhere.\n",
    " \n",
    "The Venn diagram below will give you a more clear understanding of the merge operations \n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Merge in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets take a look at how you can implement merging with `pandas`. Lets say we have two dataframes `attack` and `defense` describing the attacking and defensive powers of Pokemons along with their names present in both of the dataframes. The `attack` dataframe consists only of the row indices $[1,3,5,7,9]$ whereeas `defense` consists of the first $5$ rows.\n",

    " \n",
    "Now lets do some merge operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inner merge:** Both the dataframes have only two rows in common; one with Pokemon `Ivysaur` and the other `Mega Venusaur` and since inner merge picks up only those rows common to both the dataframes, so we have the following result: Only two Pokemons **Ivysaur** and **Mega Venasaur** are common to the dataframes so while doing an inner merge it contains these two rows only.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img align=\"centre\" src=\"../images/inner.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outer merge:** It will return all the rows for both dataframes and will assign NaN values wherever the values are not present. The `attack` dataframe conatins Pokemons **Charmeleon, Mega Charizard X and Squirtle** which don't have any presence in the `defense` dataframe and so their defense attributes are **NaN**s. Similarly the instances which are in `defense` but not in `attack` will have their attack attributes represented by NaNs.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img align=\"centre\" src=\"../images/out.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Left merge:** It will return a dataframe with all the possible columns from both `attack` and `defense` dataframe but containing only `attack` dataframe instances. So, there are **NaN**s where attribute values are absent.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img align=\"centre\" src=\"../images/left.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Right merge:** It will return a dataframe with all the possible columns from both `attack` and `defense` dataframe but only for `defense` dataframe instances. So, there are **NaN**s where attribute values are absent\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " <img align=\"centre\" src=\"../images/right.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can we track merges?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of merging dataframes you can often get confused where a particular instance came from; thanks to `pandas` you can now keep a track of the merge. Just pass the `indicator=True` inside the `.merge()` to view this. For example:\n",
