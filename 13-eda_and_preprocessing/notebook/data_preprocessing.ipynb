Now the next question comes up - **What is the need to explore data?** Data exploration to visualize and analyze data helps to arrive at a hypothesis that can be tested while model building. Understanding the relationships between features and target and also among features themselves helps us validate our assumptions regarding the data before actually building the model. Also, outliers play spoilsport with any model and hence finding the outliers and removing them is of paramount importance. \n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "With data at hand you might be tempted to start gathering insights from it. But wait! Did you observe some abnormality in the data? If you hadn't then its time you explore your data and look for any sort of abnormality and whether it can be explained from the data itself. These abnormalities are referred to as outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first phase is the detection phase where you identify potential outliers. Next comes the treatment phase where you treat these abnormalities by either replacing them with some value of your choice or deleting them altogether. \n",
    "\n",
    "But always remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "**”Sometimes outliers are bad data, and should be excluded, such as typos. Sometimes they are `Roger Federer` or `Usain Bolt`, and should be kept.” It is here that domain knowledge and practical wisdom are the only ways to differentiate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are outliers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are extreme values which deviate significantly from the underlying trend of the data at hand. As per Wikipedia *\"In statistics, an outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations.\"* The image below gives a powerful represention of what you may call an outlier in true sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/outlier.jpeg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, all the numbers in the $30$s range except number $3$. That's our outlier, because it is nowhere near to the other numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**But how did outliers get introduced?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Any data science project begins with data collection phase. This phase is extremely prone to errors as mistakes might happen during data entry and the worst part is you might not even know that they got introduced in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why care about them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are undesirable values which need to be treated effectively as they significantly distort our measures as well as insights. The reasons we need to handle outliers are: \n",
    "- They distort the overall picture we obtain using descriptive statitics and data visualization as outliers can have significant effect on statistics such as mean, range etc.\n",
    "- Outliers play spoilsport with many machine learning algorithms and statistical models.\n",
    "- On the other hand some tasks like anomaly detection search exclusively for outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets proceed to discussing various methods for outlier detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outlier Detection with visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization is one of the most simple and probably the best way to look for any outliers; if present. Lets look at the different ways by which it can be accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Univariate outlier detection with BOXPLOT**: Box and whisker plots are pretty effective in pointing out outliers for a particular numerical feature. If you remember it takes advantage of the **IQR(Inter-Quartile Range)** to detect outliers. In case you forgot the below image will give you a clear idea about this method. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/iqr.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at the boxplot for `GrLivArea`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/boxplot.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can observe that values somewhat above $2700$ are considered as outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bivariate outlier detection with SCATTER-PLOT**: Apart from carrying out univariate analysis you can also do a bivariate analysis using a scatter plot. For ex: You can take an explanatory variable on the X-axes and response on the Y-axes and generate a scatter plot for the combination and visually observe outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Lets plot out `SalePrice` against `GrLivArea` to look out for abnormal houses. The code snippet is shown below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\n",
    "plt.scatter(X_train['GrLivArea'], y_train['SalePrice'], color='red', marker='x')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The plot looks something like this: <img src='../images/scatter.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can clearly observe there are two values at the bottom right of the scatter plot. Don't they look suspicious to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "You would expect the prices to rise as the living area increases (common sense). But in this scenario it is the exact opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outlier detection with mathematical functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical functions like standard deviation, quantiles etc provide an efficient and robust mechanism to detect outliers. Lets look at a few of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-score**: You have already studied about z-scores in statistics concepts. It is a process of mapping data into a distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$. You can use z-score as per your convenience; for ex: within $3$ standard deviations, you can take data to be outliers. The z-score is a very convenient method as data points farther away from the mean occur very less. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/zscore.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "  Lets look at the Pythonic implementation for outliers.  We have made a function `outliers_zscore` to calculate Z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to calculate outliers with Z-score\n",
    "def outliers_zscore(data, column):\n",
    "    # threshold above 3 standard deviations\n",
    "    threshold = 3\n",
    "    # mean and standard deviation\n",
    "    mean, std = np.mean(data[column]), np.std(data[column])\n",
    "    # Z-scores\n",
    "    zscores = [(y_i - mean) / std for y_i in data[column]]\n",
    "    # Index for outliers\n",
    "    idx = np.where(np.array(zscores) > threshold)[0]\n",
    "    outlier =  data[column].iloc[idx]\n",
    "    return outlier\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying `outliers_zscore()` on `GrLivArea` gives us the following data points (index values for `GrLivArea`) as output.\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(outliers_zscore(X_train['GrLivArea']))\n",

    "gives the following as the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/outlier_snippet.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capping methods**: These methods take advantage of the concept of percentiles to segregate outliers. A typical example is excluding data points which are in the lower $5$ percentile and the upper $5$ percentile i.e. values lying outside range of $5$th and $95$th percentile can be considered as outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Pythonic implementation is shown below:\n",

    "    # Join all the outlier rows\n",

    "### 1.3 Treatment of  outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous topic you learnt about outlier detection. Now that you have detected their presence (if outliers are there in your dataset), its time to treat them appropriately so that they do not affect the learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to treat outliers once you detected them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you had detected outliers, what to do with them? This is probably the hardest question to answer. Most parametric statistics like mean, standard deviation, correlation and every statistic based on them are highly sensitive to outliers.  And since the assumptions of common statistical procedures like linear regression and ANOVA, are also based on them, outliers really mess up your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of model you are thinking to train on the data also has a significant impact. For ex: linear models are prone to outliers and hence wouldn't be a good choice for datasets with a significant number of outliers. For these kind of datasets an outlier agnostic model like tree based models would be  a great choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, there is **NO** best way to detect and remove outliers. You can and should try out a good number of combinations after very careful examination of the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Treating outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leave it as it is**: In cases where your intuition leads to the conclusion that it is a valid data point, leave the outlier data point in its original state. This type of situation arises when you perform anomaly detection where your main goal is in fact to detect irregularities which are nothing but outliers in the making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing the outliers**: Removing data is not a good method at any cost as it leads to loss of information. However, if your dataset has few outliers then it is safe to remove them. Lets look at a way to remove outliers for our dataset feature `'LotFrontage'`. The before (with outliers) and after (without outliers) boxplot are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| With outliers | Without outliers |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| <img src='../images/with_1.png'> | <img src='../images/without_1.png'> |\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected since you have removed all data points above and below $1.5IQR$ for Q1 and Q3 you will have zero outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impute outliers**: This method suggests imputing outlier data points with other statistics such as mean, median etc or by taking average of nearby values. Imputing can be useful when you have many variables and don't want to throw away a record for a relatively-low-importance variable."

Lets look at the common ways of handling missing data:\n",

Also, if any of the features has a high number of missing values then you can safely drop that particular feature. For example in our dataset the feature `PoolQC` has the highest percentage of missing values (**a staggering 100%**) and therefore can be safely eliminated from both training and test features. In fact this is a task at the end of the section. Be prepared to perform it!\n",

To make permanent changes to the dataframe, use the argument `inplace=True` inside `.dropna()`. Lets look at an example of the implementation of `.dropna()`:\n",

If you intend to carry out linear modelling, then normality assumption is a good precursor although not mandatory to make for modelling purposes. Also, transformation by this method help us in reducing the impact of outliers in our data. For ex: Boxcox transformation is an excellent transformation technique which is very robust to outliers.

    "### 2.2 Standardizing and normalizing continuous variables\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation for transforming continuous features**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the times, your dataset will contain features highly varying in magnitudes, units as well as range.  However, most of the machine learning algorithms use Eucledian distance between two data points in their computations and this is a major problem. Because if left alone, these algorithms only take in the magnitude of features neglecting the units. The results would vary greatly between different units; for example 5km and 5000m. Obviously in this case the features with high magnitudes (5000m) will weigh in a lot more in the distance calculations than features with low magnitudes (5km) although the latter might actually be of far greater value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to transform numerical features so that they are on the same scale. This makes features comparable as well as stabilizing the learning process of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different types of rescaling techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at some of the common ways of achieving continuous feature transformation via rescaling and apply it on the `LotFrontage` feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scaling**: Take a value, subtract it by the minimum value and divide it by the difference of the maximum and minimum value. It normalizes the range of features to the range [0, 1] or [-1.1] depending on choice.  In this type you will end up with smaller standard deviations, which can suppress the effect of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An example demonstrating min-max scaling is shown below with the formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/min_max.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "   For ex: $x = 55$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $min (x) = 35$\n",
    "      \n",
    "   $max (x) =77$\n",
    "      \n",
    "   $z = \\frac{(55- 35)} {(77- 35)} = 0.47$\n",
    "      \n",
    "   *Scikit-learn implementation pseudocode*: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import packages\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize scaler object\n",
    "scaler = MinMaxScaler()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit on training data with columns of interest\n",
    "scaler.fit(X_train[columns])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transform on training data with columns of interest\n",
    "X_train[columns] = scaler.fit_transform(X_train[columns])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transform on test data with columns of interest\n",
    "X_test[columns] = scaler.fit_transform(X_test[columns])    \n",
    "```\n",
    "Applying this `scaler` object on `LotFrontage` gave new values which look something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### 2.3 Encoding categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms support categorical values without further manipulation but there are algorithms that don't. Therefore, there is the challenge of figuring out how to turn these kind of attributes into numerical values for further processing. **There is no single BEST answer on how to approach this problem. Each approach has trade-offs and has potential impact on the outcome of the analysis.** Fortunately, Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn provide several approaches that can be applied to transform the categorical data into suitable numeric values. \n",
    " \n",
    "In our housing dataset, the columns `SaleCondition` and `GarageType` are categorical in nature. `SaleCondition` contains values like `Normal`, `Partial`, `Abnormal` while `GarageType` has `Attchd`, `Detchd`, `BuiltIn`. Lets look at the ways by which you can convert them into numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Label encoding**: It convert each value in a column to a number where numerical labels are always between 0 and $\\text{number of categories} - 1$. Lets look at the ways to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *With the help of pandas*: Use `.cat.codes` attribute to convert a particular feature to numbers; but before that set the data type for that feature to category using `.astype('category')`. **It converts different values for a feature alphabetically i.e. `A` to 0, `B` to 1 and so on.** A sample snippet is shown below where we convert `SaleCondition` to category:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert to category type using type casting\n",
    "X_train['SaleCondition'] = X_train['SaleCondition'].astype('category')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label encode 'SaleCondition' feature\n",
    "X_train['SaleCondition'] = X_train['SaleCondition'].cat.codes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Look at the first five rows\n",
    "print(X_train.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output of the code is:\n",
    "<img src='../images/cat.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the categories for `SaleCondition` has been converted to numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *With scikit-learn*: Use `LabelEncoder` function from scikit-learn's `preprocessing` module and fit-transform on the data. This method also encodes data alphabetically. An example snippet is shown below:\n",
    "   \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import packages\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize encoder object\n",
    "encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit-transform on data\n",
    "X_train['SaleCondition'] = encoder.fit_transform(X_train['SaleCondition'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the code is the same:\n",
    "<img src='../images/cat.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One-hot-encoding**: Although label encoding is intuitive and may give you a good performance from your learning algorithm, but it has a disadvantage that the numerical values can be very often misinterpreted by the algorithm; especially in the case of nominal values. For ex: you map Male and Female as 1 and 0 respectively and the learning algorithm places more emphasis on Males (due to 1); but actually there is no such thing as more or less for gender as it is a nominal variable. So, there comes another approach called **One-hot encoding**. In this approach each category of a particular feature is made into a new column and assign a `1` or `0` (`True`/`False`) value to the column. This has the benefit of not weighting a value improperly. Now lets look at some ways to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *With pandas*: Pandas lets you do this with the help of `.get_dummies()` method. An example is shown below where we create a new dataframe `df` for categories on `SaleCondition`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# One-hot encoding on 'SaleCondition\n",
    "df = pd.get_dummies(X_train['SaleCondition'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# First five rows\n",
    "print(df.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output is: <img src='../images/ohe_1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the categories have been first converted into numbers $0-5$ and then they are represented by columns with values either $1$ or $0$. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - *With scikit-learn*: Scikit-learn does the same thing as `.get_dummies()` but with the `LabelBinarizer` function from `preprocessing` library. Lets look how with code snippet:\n",
    "   \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import packages\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize encoder\n",
    "encoder = LabelBinarizer()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit and transform on data\n",
    "print(pd.DataFrame(encoder.fit_transform(X_train['SaleCondition']), columns=[0,1,2,3,4,5]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "     0  1  2  3  4  5\n",
    "0    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "1    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "2    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "3    1  0  0  0  0  0\n",
    "4    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "5    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "6    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "7    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "8    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "9    0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "10   0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "11   0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "12   0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    "13   0  0  0  0  0  1\n",
    "14   0  0  0  0  0  1\n",
    "15   0  0  0  0  1  0\n",
    ".....................\n",
    ".....................\n",
    "```\n",
    "   One-hot encoding seems very promising but it has the disadvantage that it increases our number of features which might lead to too many features and give rise to the **curse of dimensionality**. It is a curse to work in higher dimensions because normal things tend to break in such cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "   So, there is a definite trade-off between Label and Ohe hot encoding and since there is no proper method to figure out which is the correct way to encode, we strongly suggest to try out both these methods or decide on a particular method after careful consideration."
