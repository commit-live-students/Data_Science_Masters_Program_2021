    "First let us understand the difference between a traditional computer program and a machine learning program. We will understand the differences through an example. Suppose we are trying to program how to recognise a car from a set of images. A typical traditional program would help you identify a car through a set of rules. General rules for a car are \n",
    "- it has wheels\n",
    "- it has headlight.\n",
    "- it has steering wheel\n",
    "\n",

Now how would you test whether the child has truly understood multiplication or simply memorised the tables? A good way to do that would be to give unseen data to test the child like $11*12$. Here we can say that $1*1$ to $9*9$ is the training data and $11*12$ is the test data.\n",

To do that, we divide the data into two parts - Training data and Test data. We use training data to learn the given model. And then, we use the test data to evaluate the model. What `learning a model` actually means, we will study it in other concepts down the line. Broadly there are two types of supervised learning tasks - Classification and Regression. \n",
