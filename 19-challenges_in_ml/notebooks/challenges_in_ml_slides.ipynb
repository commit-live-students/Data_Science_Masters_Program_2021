    "* It generates synthetic examples in a less application-specific manner, by operating in feature space rather than data space.\n",

    "* For instance, if the amount of over-sampling needed is 200%, only two neighbors from the five nearest neighbors are chosen and one sample is generated in the direction of each.\n",
