    "As on the above task, we have seen that `73%` claim was not made  and `27%` claim made. So if you applied model on this dataset it will give us a bad prediction. To overcome we need to use the technic Oversampling or Undersampling technic. Oversampling in data analysis is techniques used to adjust the class distribution of an imbalanced dataset. In this task, you are going to apply the `SMOTE` to adjust the class distribution of the data set. While working with the learning model, it is important to scale the features to a range which is centered around zero so that the variance of the features are in the same range. If the feature’s variance is orders of magnitude more than the variance of other features, that particular feature might dominate other features in the dataset and our model will not train well which gives us bad model\n",
