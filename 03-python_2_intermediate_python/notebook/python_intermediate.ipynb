    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In data manipulation and analysis, you will often come across reading and writing files. Python can handle files of different types including `txt`, `JSON`, `HTML`, `CSV` etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at the pipeline to handle file operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Open the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say that you have a text file named `months.txt`. How to open this file? We use the `open()` function to open files and its syntax is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)`** \n",
    "\n",
    "For now lets focus only on the `path` and `mode` arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open the file passing the `path` argument to the `open()` function. Here, `file` is the file path of the file `months.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may want to use the file plainly for reading but in some cases you may want to modify it also. For this purpose, use the argument `mode`to chose how you want to treat the file object. Below are some of the mode options:\n",
    "- `'r'` : use for reading\n",
    "- `'w'` : use for writing\n",
    "- `'x'` : use for creating and writing to a new file\n",
    "- `'a'`: use for appending to a file\n",
    "- `'r+'` : use for reading and writing to the same file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Read the file\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step you read the contents of the file. It can be done in several ways:\n",
    "- **`<file>.read()`**: It returns the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "- **`<file>.readline()`**: It returns the next line of the file, returning the text up to and including the next newline character. Simply put, this operation will read a file line-by-line.\n",
    "- **`<file>.readlines()`**: It returns a list of the lines in the file, where each item of the list represents a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Write to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file use **`<file>.write()`**. The `write()` method does not add a newline character ('\\n') to the end of the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Close the file\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Python automatically closes a file when the object reference changes, it is considered a good practice to close the file. It keeps our data safe and nothing could access the data which makes it safe. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is done with the help of the **`<file>.close()`** method."

    "- **`Syntax Error`**: As the name itself suggests they happen due to incorrect syntax of our code. **Remember that syntax errors occur at compile time.** \n",

    "    \n",
    "- **`Exceptions`**: An exception is a Python object that represents an error. If the normal flow of the program gets disrupted inspite of being syntactically correct, Python raises an exception; which if not handled properly, the program will terminate. **Remember that exceptions always occur at run-time.** Python comes with various built-in exceptions as well as the possibility to create self-defined exceptions which we will be discussing in the upcoming topics.\n",

    "Let us look at an example of raising exceptions:\n",
    "\n",

    "**How does Python handles exceptions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python handles exceptions using the `try` and `except` blocks. Any code that we think might throw an error is placed inside the `try` block. If an exception is raised, control flow leaves this block immediately and goes to the `except` block which handles the corresponding exception. \n",

Since Python is a multi-paradigmed language, it supports object oriented programming (OOP).\n",
