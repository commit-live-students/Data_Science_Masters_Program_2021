  Pigs
  When young up to being kild for bacon
When they are young you have to wate 3 days then you can injeck them for
pneumonia diseases you have mack shore they have drye straw when you
clean them out you should not leave a falk in with them because the mother
might nock it down and the little pigs might stab them souve we give the
worme pouder that is when they get the worme this will stop them from
going thin you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can ge out of the way of there mother some people put a
light in with theme to geep them warm you have to make shore that mother
has a lot of milk. If she as not got a nougth milk you will have to feed them
on a bottle when they came eat a little bit you can get them some little nuts of
fating they can eate some meal when they get a little biger we give them
some fating food called Nomber 2 whe you wean that is take them from their
mother you have got to see if they fight if there is any little wones fighting
when they and bing [when they are big] you have to see about waying
[weighing] when they have been waid and reddy to go away to be kild.

and father were always shouting at each other the people across the street
could hear them figthing the children would cry Tommy was the oldest he
was 12 he was more groon up that than the others. Jane was 8 she was
frightened of her mum and dad Jone was 5 and Alan 1 1/2 years.  He was to
young to to understand he was crying all the time never the less.

  It happened to me
When I was 4 years old I very nearly diad.  It was one sunday when my 3
older sisters and I were out for a walk I had my photo taken near a brook.  I
still have the photo.  The brook was about 8 feet wide.  The water was about
2 feet deep.  But they was 6 feet off wet slimy mud I was the first to cross the
bridge it broke and in I went.  I slolly sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters
ran home but my oldest sister stoped and saved my life she held my head
above water untill my sisters got home and told my parents. then they
raced down to the brook dad have a hell of a Job pulling me out as the mud
held me down eventually his got me out and carred me home. my clothes
had to me distrod it took seven bath to get me clearn.

Im am never alloud to sit up and watch programes not surtebull for children
one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out, they was a
film on TV unfitt for children I sat and watched it, it was all murder and kill-
ing, men were being hung and other were being shot or stabed.  men had
their heads cut in half . . .

  My work on a farm
I have live on a farm all off my life, I am not bosting but I think I know a fair bit
about farming.  I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery.  Some
people say farming is the lowest payed and hardest working imployment out. I
agree with those people.  but I would rather work for my living, than just siting in a
stufy old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do. Give me the open
air life.  My father is a farm stockman and I hope to take on the same Job when I
leave school. I am going to take my apprentiship course when I leave at easter. that
means that I go to classis ones a week.  I will learn a lot more about farming and if I
pull through the course I will be a usfull chap about the farm. Will [while] I am
taking my course I will be get 17 shilling less than the boy worker that is not taking
the course. But when I am 17 and finished my Apprentiship I will get 10% more
than the average pay off a boy my age.  Many people asked me why I have choosen
farming as my future carrer.
  (1) I will be in the open air.
  (2) I will be doing a diffrent Job every day
  (3) I am not interested in enthing else.
For the last 2 or 3 years I am have been work on the farm in the holidays.  And I can
tell the men I have worked with have been good and give me a few tips.  my dad
has told quite a lot about farming which I know will help when I life school.  So if
anybody want an open air life, choose FARMING

As I looked at this picture it made me think the people were druck.  The
people throw the thinks on the floor.  The woman put the baby in the chair
in the corner so that they can have a sleep.  They opened the window to let
the fresh air in.  This picture we panted in the olden days.  It was dark in
the house but not out side.  It looks to me as if it was raining.  The dog is licking up
the scraps.  The bird is up in his cage wondering what is happing. Look at the old
fashion shoes. They socks come up to the top of they legs like long grandpas pants.
One of the children are playing with the fire.

  When a woman looks in her Pram
One day a young woman went down the street to do her shopping.  She
went into the shop to order her weekly meat, of course she left her baby out
side the shop.  Her baby was still sitting her its pram, but the little baby was
crying.  the little baby could not talk much he could say little words.  He's Mum
said to him "Now what are you crying for My little baby, "he keep on "Man,
Man,", he mean't that Man which were going down the road, at first she
could not understand him you see this man had a black baby in a blue pram
And a woman came over the road a said "you better watch were you leave
you baby misses." the baby's mothers said "why" so the other lady" said,
"because you know that old man which as Just gone down the road, well
he tried to take your little baby out of it's pram.
So she said "thank you very much for telling me, and said "good-bye-
So the lady walk on with her baby.
This time she went into the baker's to get some bread.
The old man with the baby was outside the fishmonger, which was just
aside the baker's. The Lady went in, and while she was in the man changed
babys.  So he had the white one and she had the black one, of course he ran
away, no one saw him.  She came out of the Baker's and looked in her pram a
saw the baby asleep.  She went home a while the baby was a sleep she done
some jobs. When she had done her jobs she said to herself  "the babys is
having a long sleep.  I go and see if he is still asleep.  She opened the down and she
sow a black baby sitting in her pram she shouted.  after she had shouted she put
on her coat and went and phone the police.  The police said they would be
here in a very few minetes. As soon as she had a knock on the door, she said
"Come in," it was the policemen. The police said, "What can we do for
you Miss.
So she said "This is not my baby I had a white one so the police said when did
you first find out she said just a minute ago. Just be-fore I phoned you. One
of the police said "did you leave it out side a shop, and she said "yes while I
went in the baker's. (she was crying) The other policeman said.  "tell us the
whole story" So she told them to sit down aud asked them if they wanted a
cup of tea they said yes.  So she put on the kettle and then sat down and told
then the story about her baby.  And the police said they would try and find
her own baby.
  The very long days went by and still they couldn't find the baby, but
afterawhile the police heard a little about the baby.  The women was very
upset.
  And one day the two polce men came to her house holding a white baby.
So the women grab the baby and said thank you very much for finding him.
I will give you #5 ponds reward. the policemen took the #5 ponud and
shared it.
  And the old woman lived happy ever after and all ways took her own baby were
ever she went.
  The end.

  AN APPLE
It comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your
mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name gascoyne's
scarlet.  when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance
of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.  when you go scrumping you have got to
be carefull you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you
next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples.  when I go scrumping all I
go after is apples and plums, pears.  when you go pinching apple you do not want to
take to many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people
with you a specally little boys they make too much noise.  If you pick apples off of
the ground you have to be carful of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting
comes up to a big bump where ever it stings you.  when you are by yourself and some
one comes and you have to climb over the barb wire and get caught the man will
probally catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you.  some people
when the catch you they might hit you and said he will hit you harder next time he
catches you.  But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come
in the orchard again  But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat.
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses.  when  I go
scrumping I do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come
along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and
that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard.  I never
take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be reconnised very easy because red
shows up very easy.  But still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.

  The Fox
  The fox is a sly old beast
  He sits in his den cleaning and waiting
  To make a nother savage attack
  He walks the field to the farm
  The smell of chickens in the passing breeze.
  he's gone to collect his meal.
  He makes a leap.
  Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal.

  WINTER
  When the snow lay round about
  The robins come out to seek crumbs
  Their feet are numb
  But the snow still lies round about.
  A tree is a place for song
  That's where birds sing their sweet song.
  The leaves have gone.
  It will not be long before the tree has gone.

  Stranden on a Desert Island
One midsummer's day at 9.30 a.m. a ship was wrecked by a corral reef so
people jumped overboard. People who could not swim did not know it was
a case of life or death The ship was sinking fast but some still hung on. the
shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore.
Getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship
could get down to the store room and get some diving out fits.  So one man
volonteered to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room.  Their
were dead bodys on the deck within 20 minutes of the ship wreck.  Their
were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island.
The man who swam from the island went down to the store room. He held
his breath as he went down below the surface of the water.  As he open the
store room door the water gushed in very quickly. So he had to feel for the diving
suits.  He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only
5.  He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they
sent to men to help him.  When they arrived they all put their diving suits
on the went down to get some food. Lucky enough it was mostly tin food.
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island. When looking
around the deck they saw a life boat but it had a little hole in one side but they
thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in.  They all had
one tin of something each.  They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough.
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started
looking for coconuts.  They all decided that there would only be two meals a
day.  most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested.
There was about 35 on the island but people who use't to get coconuts usally
got lost or got bitten by a snake.  They had shortend done from 35 to 15.
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to.  And
they could also catch fish to eat.  After several weeks ships had seen them
waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so
they kill animals and drank fresh water from springs.  they found here and
there.  they found coconuts while hunting for animals.  They took the coco-
nuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside.
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the gound and
sticks laide across with grass on top of them.  At night they slept all together
under coconut trees.  They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning.
One morning in decernber a ship was going across the sea to England they
waved and waved again.  Then the ship began to turn and was coming to
fetch them they were all delighted.  As soon ass they arrived on board the
sailors told them to report to the captain's office.  They all too pleased to be
on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they
replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since.  They
arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England
again. THE END

  My family
There are Eight of us in my family counting my mother and Farther. I
have two sisters, one Janet one Edna.  Three brothers Terry Sturt and Goef
. . . I think my family is awful because I get blamed for nely everything if one
of my brothers hit any own else I get all the blame. . .

I got a bag nearly ful and then I soor a man with a gun coming across the
meddow after me, I put my bag over my shoulder and run, the old man
come after me he seid stop or else I will blow your hed right off. I said shut
your gob and I took two apples out of my bag and through them at him, one hit him
in the guts and hit him on the bonce, he fell too the ground and lay there, and I said
to my self thats a good Job now I can eat my apples.

  LEAVING SCHOOL
When I leav school I am going to work up the petrol pumps at Mr Sturgess's
at Mording.  I work up there at weekend and in the holidays.
I like working up there because I meet all kinds of people. They have a farm
attached to it they keep a few pigs up the farm and a few down the road in a
meadow. They have a tractor and a trailer. They are two brothers Frank and
John. John is my boss.  Frank has four cars two which go and two which do
not go. John owns the tractor and trailer and all the pigs and a cattle lorry
and Frank owns one bullock one cow and one effer.

  THE FARM
When I go up the farm on saturday morning I go down the yard and start up
the tractor, and back the trailer on and go up the yard, then clean the pigs
out with John, then the lorry. Then we go back down the yard and unload
the dung.  Then I started the tractor up a gain, and went out on too the fild.
Then we an cafferd some manggles [uncovered some mangolds], and loaded
them up we got three loades before dinner from about 11.30 until about 1.
oclock. When we come back from dinner we started the tractor up again
and went for a nother load, we got for more loades before tea the last one we
go stuck with.  But we soon got out of theat when John put some bricks un-
der the wheels
This is the tractor witch I drive at week ends, and in the holidays.
You have to start it by a handle and you have to turn the petrol on and when
you get it going you have to let it warm up first and then turn it on to T.V.O.
Then away you go.
It is a low gird tractor it has three fowd girse and 1 reveirse.
It has for silinders and a high drollit lift [hydraulic lift].  the many fold as
[manifold has] burnt out so smoke and flames and sparks fly out of the botton
of it.
if you fill the radyator up with water it will last for 10 minutes becouse it
has a hole in the bottom of it as big round as a sixpence.


  The Sick Sow.
Last week I went up the farm and Bill told me that he had just bought a
black and white sow. He said it fed all right for the first three days, but now
she won't feed a tall.
So I said let me come and look at here, so we went and had a look at here,
and she was lame on the here right, front leg.
I said to Bill no wonder she dus not feed very well, she is lame on her front
leg.
Bill said she will not feed a tool, well let me see the kind of grub you give
here then.
So Bill showed me, I said dont you give the old gell any brain no said bill

straw in the place where she sleeps and out in the yard.

  The Old Bull
One day I went round old man Joneses farm and he and some of his work men
had got the bull out in the yard.  As I went in the gate the old bull started to
tern on me, so old man Jones, said get behind that old cart Joe. About 4 or
5 minutes after, I came out from behind the cart.  They had got the old bull
back in the shed. Then he asked me  if I would held him bring daisy the old
cow up to go with the old bull, because he thinks that she ought to have a
nothing calf.
  So he put here in with old Toogey the bull he got on here back and we
let him stay with here fore about half of an hour.  About four to five
month after she had been with the old bull she had a calf it was a bull
calf.  When it was about ten weeks old, when we sold it it made #15.10s. 6d.
Then the time came for the old bull to be sold he was to old and fat for the

because he didn't have a girl to go out with.
  Then he saw his friend in the distance, he name was Jean Smith, she was
very attractive but she already had a boy so there was no good ever waiting
for her, when Jean got to the Cafe door, she was very surprised to find Rex
there, and she said my goodness you do look glum today whats the matter, said
Jean.  Well I haven't anything to do of an evening now said Rex", Well
never mind, come on into the cafe and have a cup of coffee, all right said Rex,

  When I leave School
When I leave school I want to be a children's nurse, I shall most probably got
to London to get a really good Job, but I will have to be away from home, but
my parents said they don't mind me being away from home, as long as I
like the Job, and am very interested in the work, of course I will be able to
come home for a few days.  I am going to leave school at 15, at Easter, 1962,
and I shall work for two years at least before I think about getting a boy.  I
want to get married at 20, so that I will have about three years to get engaged,
and to get to know each other.  I wand two children, one of each or twins. I
also want to live in a bungalow I want a man with lovely black or brown
wavey hair not much taller than me.  I want a man that likes children and
takes them out, and plays with them.  Then we will all be able to go out and
enjoy ourselves.  I shall stop nursing when I get married, after I have had a
child, then I may do part-time work.  I want to get married in white.  I want
to go abroad for my honeymoon.  For the first summer holiday, I would like
to go to Butlin's holiday camp.
For my children I would like a blue and white or Black pram.

Stephen asked me if I would like to go, so he bought two tickets for him and
me, and we went in and Pauline and Trevor were sitting in there holding
hands.  So we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them, and
we did and when the film started all the lights were put out, and it was very
dark in there, then Stephen was sitting there next to me, and Pauline said go
on Stephen hold Judith's hand, and after a while he did, and he didn't let go of
it until the film was over. . . the best boyfriend I ever had . . . he's father
was posted . . . and so Stephen left.  But we still send letters and post cards
to each other.  So that we still remember each other . . .

One fine morning I got up, and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee,
but at my disaster I found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep, so I
grabbed it quick and brought it in, it was a baby boy with light hair and blue
eyes, well of course I would have loved to keep the child but I knew that wouldn't be
right, so I telephoned the Police, and told them everything that had happened,
and told me to take the baby down to the Police station.  So I got ready and
set off to the station.  Of course I liked the baby and didn't want to give it to
the Police.  They said that they would put up notices about the baby.  They let
me look after him until someone owned up.
  A month later.
A month went but nobody owned up and the Police were tired of looking
everywhere for the parents that they said I could adopt the baby if I wanted to,
if not they would put it in a home.  I soon got married and talked it over with
my husband, and he said it was OK, with him so, in a few day's time the
baby was ours and were'nt we pleased.  So we all lived happily ever after.
  The End.

  When I am a children' Nurse
When I get the Job of a children's nurse, I shall be very happy I'm sure, There
will be lots of other nurse's there to help look after the children we have to put
the children to bed, and get then dressed, give them there food, and toys to
play.  I like looking after young children, I will be able to get home now and
then, and see may parents.  If one of the children decide that they want to
run away then of course we must go and look for them, and bring them back.

  IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS.
One day, about the second week, I was going shopping, and takeing my
friend for a walk.  When three boys whistled at me and they asked me to
come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags, for me, of
course I went as red as beetroot, but when I came back they called me again
so after a while I went and Picked it up I started talking to them every
day . . .

Betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner, they got 2 lb
of potatoes, 1 large tin beans, and 1/2lb ham, and 1 large peaches and 1 large
cream which all came to 6/- 10d, when they got home the girls cooked the
meal . . .

they started out and the sea got deeper, but it was lovely, the sun was shining
like a star glittering at night, the sea was calm and bright, as we looked ahead
at the deep deep sea, it was just like a dream which has come true . . .

  Because its night time and dark.  Because the wind is wild.  Because the
  two waves are a ring.  It's where the sea has washed away
  The side of the rocks.
  The front of the boat
  Where the sea ran up the beach.
  Because there are trees in way
  There whispering to each other
  The sun is hot with wild animals roaming around.
  The beach is so hot and the sea is calm, animals are roaming, here and
  there.

in it lived mother, father, maids, and four children, the eldest, was Jenny
who was 18 years of age, she had 3 other brothers and sisters who were all

to get marreid, they had known each other for 6 years, and were very much
in love.  They had got mostly everything to start with, they had a double
bed, curtains, dressing table, crockery and lots of other things to start a
married home.  But thee only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give
their consent, to the marriage.  So the two young children decided to ran
away and get married.  So they packed a few clothes and Johnny got two
tickets on a train to London they had some money in the bank about #30.  So
one bright sunny morning they got up about six oclock and made their way
to the station.  they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had
some breakfast.  Soon they were on the train. Now we needn't worry
about anythink my darling, said Johnny.  No we can get a job in London and
live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own, said
Jenny.  yes then we can go back home, tell our parents, the news and get the
rest of our things together and come back to London.

They got a flat and were now thinking of getting married, so they got mar-
ried in a registery office and after the celebrate until 12 oclock that night,
then a week later they got tickets back to Lawton, they got home and went
and rang on Jenny's doorbell first.  he father came to the door, and took one
look and "slammed!" the door in their faces, and shouted out "I don't
know where you've been, but I don't want you to lay a step inside this
house, you're an absolute disgrace to our family, but dad, shouted Jenny I've
only come home to tell you the news what's that he "said" I am married
thats why I and Johnny ran away we got married in a registry office.  so
"said" her father, Oh ! well I wish you the best of luck in your marriage, but
I do wish you'd told us all--because I think you are old enough to be man
and wife, well my daughter and son in law, welcome home.  you can live
here both of you, until you get a decent place of your own, thank you dad,
and thank you sir, said Johnny, don't call me sir my son, you're one of us
now so, you may as well call me dad I must go and fetch youre parents Johnny,
and we will celebrate said her father, all the family got together and cele-
brated.  and later they got a place of their own and a couple of years later
they had twins a boy and a girl, and they all lived happily ever after.

Dear Les,
I hope you are O.K. just a few lines to write about our English lesson with
Mr Holbrook in the last 12 months.  He has taught us how to write good
letters, stories, and poems.  some of the work he has taught us will be of use
to us in later years.  But some work hasn't taught us a single thing, we have
to learn a fair bit of English to help us as we get older, and out to work.
  Love and best wishes,
  Judith

After hunger, ses is our strongest instinct and greatest problem, toensure the

give to us males such sensitivity to woman's charms that we can go quite mad
in their pursuit . . . our ancestors played down this exual impulse.  we have
simulated it unwisely with advertisement and display, and have armed it
with the doctrine that inhibition is danger-ous.  Yet inhibilion--the control of

  The Blind Date.
Ones a apen a time there was a boy named Rex.  He was handsome and he
had black hair.  but one night he came down stairs.  He went to wacth the
Television. he got fed up, he went out for a walk and he met Jean his friend.
He was so sad that Jean asked him was the matter. He said wants a girlfriend.
Jean says she will take him to a girl called audrey watson who works at the
greenhouse in Melton. So after he had met her he said to her alone whats are
you doing tonight and she said she will have to do a job for her maneger.  he
siad well perhaps wel go to the pictures tomorrow and she said yess Ill be
there to meet you.
The next day audrey came to his house.  Then they were both ready so they
set out to go the picture.  When they get to the pictures they saw a lovely
picture they say it was a very nice picture but when they came out of the
picture.  they had an argument.

When I leave school I am going to ask my mother and father if I can be a
nana.  And if I do I am going to look after little children and when I am 15 or
16 I might even get a boyfriend.  But not until then I am going to take my
dog for a walk when I get him around the village.
My mother father and my brother and I are going to mass tonight because it
is Holy obligation.  I hope we get a bungalow soon because the house what
we're in is a dump.  We don't like it.  I hope we do because a bungalow is
better than a cottage.  well for one thing it untied anyway it is not ours it
belongs to Mr Lyons.  Evey time my father goes in the Bake-house he sneezes
evey time.
It is my birthday on Monday We went out on Saturday and my mother
bought me a new pink coat and high heels.  To wear and go out in for best.

  My family
I live in Melton and I am in a cottage and it is horrible we dont like it but still
we have to Persevere till we leave.  Bernard is ill in bed and the Docter is coming
to see him on Wednesday Morning he felt sick on the football ground on
Saturday aftemoon.  Our dog Tobe has been Excited but its a very cute dog. I have
got a bunk which I sleep in.  my brother has a singl bed and my mother and
father has one to.  we he havn't any cats but we used to do we used to have
roundabout 12 but they all disapeared.  I shoud think we will be leaving some
time my Mtoher will be glad when we do leave this cottage we all do we
dont no about the dog it might be different for him because he is used to that but
never mind he will get used to that as well.  We all want to go were our
Relatons but my mother dosnt want to go to Leiston but I do I like it very
much. I dont now know about my father and my brother but I know that
they would like it.  Ther are six in my family counting the dog and the bird.
we have a garden and it has only grass on each side Well on the left of the
garden was a hole in the middle and there was mice in it down the bottom of
it.  Well one of the cats meant to go outside but somthing happens he sees this hole
and he puts his paw into the hole and the mice come up a little and they grabed the
cat.  then it tried to get away but it was know use it was killed they they all came out
and then they all were killed.  Then there was my mother and father and I came
out of the house that night and saw that the cats were in the hole making a noise
but we count d anything about it because it was to late.  But have got over it.

My mother and father have been married for ten years and they have been
happy ever since.  When they started to meet.  They said shall we go to the
pictures and my mother said yes well do that said my mother it is a very good
idea.  But some times they have a fight they had a fight last night but they
made friends again then when we went out last Saturday afternoon they
started to have a fight.  My father shouted at my mother and than my mother
shouted at my father then when my father went to the meeting we went to
finish our shopping .  . .

When the children went out to play after dinner Linda and I went on the
field and sat down for a bit there were Mary Smith and Linda and I Linda
said something (and then I went up to her and got on top of her and so we
had a little play fight) but we are still friends with each other.  we go together
every day.  I like her to come to Guildwell some day but she said no she cant
there if she could she would come and see me and we would have good fun
together and go up to the meadow and climb trees

Went I went on my holiday I had a very nice time we played on the bikes
and went shopping and when my Auntie went to work but when she went
work Joan and Derek started to have a quarrel but I did not take no notice
of them and carried on what I was doing then Joan said something to me but
I did take notice of her and then she said I always startes a qurral but when we
were friends again.  Well on one Saturday when my Uncle desided to go to
the pictures with Joan and Derek well when they were in the pictures I was
in a room watching Bronco Layne on T.V. it was better than watching the
film but I mean that Bronco was very good.  Well when they came home that
night I was still watching the T.V. and Derek and Joan came in and said that
my Uncle was drunk and Joan said that he nearly got run-over and als Joan
had guard him back to the house where was safe.  Well that same night when
we were watching Deadline--midnight my Uncle came in and sat on a
chair and watched part of the programe and then came up and switched the
T.V. of and to us to go to bed we ran up stairs and Derek and I went into
my bed-room so we stay in the room and I heard someone coming up the
stairs so I went and I peped out side the door and saw that my Uncle was com-
ing up the stairs so I told Derek so we went round the bed and I got on the
bed and went straight down stairs and went into the kitchin and told my
Auutie but she said that she cant do anything about it so when he came down-
stairs again we went up stairs to bed.  And when I was in bed I lisinid out for
my Uncle because sometimes when he is drunk he comes up to my room door
but not always but it stopped me from going to sleep because sometime he
gives me the creaps but before then he very nearly hit Derek and I but I
dont know what for and then we went to bed and went to sleep but when
they all were asleep my uncle got up and came out of the room and went down
stairs I dont know what he was up to but still I kept awake a very long time
because I wasnt tired so I stayed awake for a while and when he came up-
stairs and stood outside my door I got a bit scared because I thought he was
going to come in my room so I kept so still and quiet and a bit later he went
into his own room and got in bed and went to sleep and he woke my Auntie
she was awake for a little while and then she was asleep in a know time and I
couldn't go to sleep at all but still I kept awake to listen out for my uncle just
in case he came into my room but a bit later on I fell of to sleep and I got
nice and warm.  Well thats all I can say for now.

ROSEMARY I dont surpose you want me any more so I wont come with you

BERNARD come of it I love you very much
ROSEMARY do you realy love me
BERNARD  of course I do then they started to put their arms around each
  other and then Rosemary kiss Bernard.

Sir,
  Mr. T. says Mr. Holbrook is to soft with us by not teaching us spellings. I
agree with Mr t because you can not write a good story without knowing
how to spell, I am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words differcult
but people who get under 40 find words very differcult.  If you do not
practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school.  I
think Mr Holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write
neatly so I think it is essential that we should write properly.  I have written a
lot of stories in the term I have written a lot of stories because spelling does
not slow me down so I find it quite easy . . .
  William Glebe

Sir,
  Mr T says that Mr. Holbrook, our English teacher is too soft, and does'nt
teach us very good English but I don't believe one word of it, it is absolutly
nonsense, he is a good enough teacher, for any child to learn from.
  We write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them.
  Mr T said it will be, be harder for us when we leave school, but if we
consantrate, and listern to what we are told in English we will have no
trouble when we go out into the world.
  When we write stories, I think the story is much more important than the
spellings, and puntuation.
  Yours faithfully
  Judith

When we have Mr Holbrook we have to write a story, and sometimes we
write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea your tinking of.
  Jack O'Malley

we have to work hard, and it tacks hard work to write thoese story and it
very hard when people say he soft on us . . . .
  Joan Stall

I think Mr T shoold come and see Mr. Holbrook teaching us we do a lot of
writing we have even made a frame [form] magazine . . . .
