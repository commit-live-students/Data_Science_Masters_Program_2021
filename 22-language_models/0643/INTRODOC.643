OF ENGLISH SPELLING ERRORS

     This    document    describes    a    collection     of
computer-readable  files  containing misspellings of English
words.  The collection  was  made  as  part  of  a  research
project  in  the  Department of Computer Science of Birkbeck
College, London.  The project is funded  by  the  Leverhulme
Trust;   a  grant  towards  the  data  input was made by the
Central Research Fund of the University of London.

     The collection is  made  available  for  research.   It
would  be  appreciated  if  researchers  who use any of this
material  would  make  some  acknowledgement  both  of   the
collection  and,  where appropriate, of the suppliers of the
original corpora.

     Nearly all the misspellings  in  this  collection  were
produced by native speakers of English, most of them British
though two files contain misspellings produced by Americans.
Most   of   the   misspellings   are   spelling  errors,  ie
misspellings produced by people who were  not  sure  of  the
correct   spelling,   rather   than   slips   in  typing  or
handwriting.  Some of the  misspellings  were  collected  in
spelling  tests  or  dictations,  others  from free writing.
Some are from children, others from adults;  some  are  from
people receiving special tuition in reading and writing.

     The task of gathering together these error corpora  was
undertaken  as part of a research project into the design of
a computerised spelling corrector for  poor  spellers;   the
main purpose was to indicate the range of problems that such
a corrector would  have  to  cope  with  and  to  provide  a
substantial  quantity  of  data  on  which  to test possible
methods  of  correction.   However,  I  expected  that   the
collection,  once  in  computer-readable  form,  would be of
interest to other researchers also,  and  I  have  therefore
retained in the files various items of information which are
not of particular interest to me but which may  be  of  more
interest to others.

     I have not collected any  of  this  material  at  first
hand;   it  already existed in one form or another.  Some of
it was already in the form of computer-readable files;  some
was in published books;  some had been partially analysed in
the course of research, and some was still in  the  form  of
scripts and test papers.  My contribution has been to gather
these corpora together, to put onto the computer those  that
were  not  already  in  computer-readable  form and to write
descriptions of them.  The people who supplied me  with  the
material have read and approved these descriptions.

     There are basically ten sets of material,  though  some
of them are divided into more than one file, making 15 files
in all.  I have written a separate document on each  of  the
ten,  so  I  will  only  give a short description here.  The
first four came to me in more-or-less raw form;   the  other
six were already in the form of either files or books:

CHES

     Misspellings of thirty words by about 200  ten-year-old
children in England and Wales.  These children were a random
sample from the several thousand tested in the Child  Health
and Education Survey (CHES) in 1980.

NFER

     Misspellings made in two short dictations by  about  80
adult literacy students in England and Wales - a sample from
a  survey  conducted  by   the   National   Foundation   for
Educational Research (NFER) in 1978-79.

PERIN

     Three sets of material collected by Dr Dolores Perin in
research conducted in the late 1970's:

1) A dictation and a piece of constrained  writing  from  36
secondary-school   leavers   and   from  six  adult-literacy
students.

2) Misspellings from  free  writing  by  six  adult-literacy
students.

3) A spelling test of forty words from about 170 students in
London secondary schools.

PETERS

     Two samples of the material collected  by  Dr  Margaret
Peters  in primary and secondary schools in Cambridge in the
1960's:

1) Misspellings from about 150 children  in  spelling  tests
and  dictations  at  the  ages  of  9,  10  and 11, and in a
spelling test and a piece of free writing at age 15 (ie each
child at four different ages).

2)  Misspellings  from  short  compositions  by   over   900
fifteen-year-olds.

ASHFORD

     The complete text of  'The  Young  Visiters'  (sic)  by
Daisy  Ashford,  a short novel written by a nine-year-old in
Victorian England;  the text contains many of  her  original



                                                      Page 3


misspellings.

FAWTHROP

     Two files supplied in computer-readable form  by  David
Fawthrop,  collected  in  the  course  of  his research into
spelling correction at Bradford University:

1) A compilation of four collections  of  American  spelling
errors, already in published form.

2) A collection of misspellings from the  writing  of  three
British people, all of whom considered themselves to be poor
spellers.

GATES

     The most common misspellings of 3876 words  taken  from
spelling  tests  given to schoolchildren in New York City in
the 1930's;  this material was taken from the book  'A  List
of  Spelling  Difficulties  in  3876  Words',  by  Arthur I.
Gates.

HOLBROOK

     Passages taken from the creative writing  of  about  20
children  in  a  British  secondary  school  in  the 1960's,
published (with their original misspellings) in 'English for
the Rejected' by David Holbrook.

SHEFFIELD

     A list of about 380 misspellings, mostly keying errors,
taken from typewritten or computer-terminal input, collected
from staff and students in  the  Department  of  Information
Studies  of  Sheffield  University  by  Angell,  Freund  and
Willett as  part  of  a  piece  of  research  into  spelling
correction.

WING

     Misspellings (mainly  handwriting  slips)  from  essays
written   by  40  candidates  in  the  Cambridge  University
Entrance Examinations in 1976.  This  corpus  was  collected
and put into computer-readable form by Wing and Baddeley and
is described in their paper 'Spelling errors in handwriting:
a corpus and a distributional analysis'.


     The error corpora and their  accompanying  descriptions
are  available  on  a  magnetic tape;  the data files are of
type DAT and the description files of type  DOC.   The  file
SAMPLES.DAT  contains  a copy of the first ten lines of each
of the data  files.   The  tape  produced  by  the  Birkbeck
College  computer  is  written  on  a  VAX 11/750 under VMS,



                                                      Page 4


ANSI-labelled (the tape label is SPELL),  1600  bpi,  ASCII.
All  the  files  have  fixed numbers of bytes per record and
bytes per block, but the numbers vary somewhat from one file
to another, as follows:
                              Record   Block
The DAT files:
  CHES, NFER, PERIN, PETERS       80    2000
  FAWTHROP, SHEFFIELD             40    2000
  GATES, HOLBROOK, WING, SAMPLES  95    1900
  ASHFORD                         65    1950

All the DOC files                 60    1800

     All the  DAT  files  are  text  files  containing  only
printable ASCII characters;  the same goes for the DOC files
except that they contain an ASCII form-feed at the  foot  of
each  page.   The  full  list  of  files  on  the tape is as
follows:

INTRO.DOC, SAMPLES.DAT
ASHFORD.DOC, ASHFORD.DAT
CHES.DOC, CHES.DAT
FAWTHSHEF.DOC, FAWTHROP1.DAT, FAWTHROP2.DAT
GATES.DOC, GATES.DAT
HOLBROOK.DOC, HOLBROOK.DAT
NFER.DOC, NFER1.DAT, NFER2.DAT
PERIN.DOC, PERIN1.DAT, PERIN2.DAT, PERIN3.DAT
PETERS.DOC, PETERS1.DAT, PETERS2.DAT
SHEFFIELD.DAT (for document see FAWTHSHEF.DOC)
WING.DOC, WING.DAT

     The preparation of material  for  data-entry,  and  the
subsequent  keying-in,  involved  a  good deal of work.  The
bulk of the clerical work was carried out  by  Philip  Baker
and  John  and  Kate  Murray,  and the keying-in by the Data
Preparation  Service  of  Birkbeck   College,   particularly
Barbara Whitmore.  The Ashford and Holbrook books were input
via the Kurzweil Data Entry Machine of the Oxford University
Computing Services.

     I have run various programs to check the files and have
corrected such errors as these have thrown up.  I think that
the files are reasonably free of errors  introduced  in  the
process  of transferring the material onto the computer, but
I obviously cannot guarantee that there are none at all.
