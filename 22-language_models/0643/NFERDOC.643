     There are two files of  data  obtained  from  a  survey
conducted   by   the  National  Foundation  for  Educational
Research  (NFER).   The  files  are  called  NFER1.DAT   and
NFER2.DAT.

     The file NFER1.DAT contains a random sample of 83 cases
from  a  survey  of  students  in  Adult Literacy schemes in
England and Wales undertaken  in  1978-79  by  the  National
Foundation  for Educational Research.  A short report of the
survey is given in 'A survey of attainment and  progress  of
learners  in  Adult  Literacy  schemes'  by  T.P.  Gorman in
Educational Research, 23, 3,  June  1981  (pp  190-198).   A
longer  report  is  held  in  the  library of the NFER.  The
address of the NFER is The Mere, Upton Park, Slough,  Berks,
SL1 2DQ, telephone Slough 74123.

     A sample of 41 Adult Literacy  schemes,  stratified  by
size, city-size and geographical area was drawn from a total
of 141 schemes.  The following description is taken from the
paper by Gorman:

     'The initial survey  commenced  in  December  1978  and
continued  in  some  schemes  to  March 1979.  It involved a
sample  of  1,236  students  who  had  enrolled  during  the
previous  six  months.   The  sample comprised about six per
cent of the target population.  ...  The ratio of  male  and
female  learners  was  approximately 2:1 (65.5 per cent were
male).  Just over half the students  (55.5  per  cent)  were
between 21 and 40 years old.  Twenty-two per cent were under
21 and 23 per cent over 40.'

     Several tests of reading and writing were given to  the
students.  The tests were administered on a one-to-one basis
by the students' own  tutors.   The  tests  were  graded  in
increasing order of difficulty, and students were allowed to
drop out if they found a test unreasonably  difficult.   The
data in NFER1.DAT was taken from just two of the tests.

     For the first of these, the student was given  a  sheet
of  lined  paper  with  'Dear  Mary,'  written  in  the  top
left-hand corner.  The  tutor  dictated  this  short  letter
which the student wrote down:

     'We will be coming to Leeds  on  Sunday  with  our  two
sons.   As  you  were  not  there  last time we came, we are
looking forward to seeing you again.

                Best wishes, '

     For the second of these  two  tests,  the  student  was
given  a  sheet with the following story typed on it, except
that the words in capitals were replaced by underlined gaps.

The tutor read out the story and the student wrote the words
in the gaps:

     'My FRIENDS, Joan and Arthur  live  near  the  STATION.
They  have  two  children,  both  still BABIES.  Yesterday I
WALKED over to their house to help Arthur do  some  DIGGING.
I  was  a  bit late because I had been COOKING myself HALF a
pound of  steak  and  VARIOUS  vegetables,  including  fried
POTATOES.   I  am  not used to DINING on so much, it must be
ADMITTED, but I had RECEIVED a bonus that week and I  wanted
to  celebrate.   Arthur  still  had not dug very much of the
garden when I got there .  In fact his progress  was  hardly
NOTICEABLE.'

     The following results are taken from the full report of
the  survey.   The  figures indicate the percentage spelling
the word correctly;  for example, out of  the  850  students
who  attempted  the 'Dear Mary' letter, 44% spelled 'coming'
correctly.

'Dear Mary' letter: 70% (approx 850 students) took
this test:

coming     44%     our       43%     two       50%
sons       52%     were      42%     there     50%
forward    31%     seeing    59%     again     37%
wishes     36%

'Joan and Arthur' test: 60%  (approx 730 students)
took this test:

friends    24%     station   29%     babies    17%
walked     30%     digging   26%     cooking   48%
half       33%     various    8%     potatoes  21%
dining     23%     admitted  13%     received  10%
noticeable  8%

     The data for NFER1.DAT was taken from a  random  sample
of  the  students'  scripts.   Only  the  misspellings  were
recorded.  No record was made if the student spelled a  word
correctly,  and  no record was made of omissions.  Each case
begins with the student's serial number.   The  misspellings
are then listed, each preceded by a number to indicate which
word it was a misspelling of,  according  to  the  following
key:

     1 we, 2 will,  3 be,  4 coming,  5 to,  6 leeds,  7 on,
8 sunday,  9 with,  10 our,  11 two, 12 sons, 13 as, 14 you,
15 were, 16 not, 17 there, 18 last, 19 time, 20 we, 21 came,
22 we,  23 are,  24 looking,  25 forward,  26 to, 27 seeing,
28 you, 29 again, 30 best, 31 wishes

51 friends, 52 station,  53 babies,  54 walked,  55 digging,
56 cooking,  57 half,  58 various,  59 potatoes,  60 dining,
61 admitted, 62 received, 63 noticeable



                                                      Page 3


     Capital letters (right or wrong) were  ignored.   Where
the  misspelling  contained  a  space  (as  in  'a gane' for
'again'), the space has been underlined, eg 'a_gane'.

     If a case goes onto a second or  subsequent  line,  the
line begins with a '+', and each case ends with a '!'.

     The file NFER2.DAT is just like NFER1.DAT  except  that
it  contains  a  group  of students who were recorded in the
follow-up survey (see Gorman's paper for details)  as  being
second-language  speakers  of English.  No information about
their first language was collected.
