     This  file  is  the  one  described  and  published  in
'Spelling   errors   in   handwriting:    a   corpus  and  a
distributional analysis'  by  Alan  M.   Wing  and  Alan  D.
Baddeley,  published  in  the  book  'Cognitive Processes in
Spelling', edited by Uta Frith, Academic Press  1980,  pages
251-285.  The following are extracts from that paper:

     'The errors ..   were  all  those  found  in  the  exam
scripts  of forty male, secondary school candidates applying
for  entrance  to   Cambridge   colleges   in   engineering,
mathematics  or  natural sciences.  The exam was the General
Paper of November 1976 and candidates were required to  give
essay-type  answers to three self-selected questions.  These
were marked by the examiners in  terms  of  the  candidates'
ability   to  formulate  cogent  arguments  and  to  express
themselves clearly in written  English.   Three  hours  were
allowed for writing the examination.

     'After the scripts  were  no  longer  required  by  the
examiners,   forty   were   selected  at  random.   A  small
proportion of the scripts where there was reason to  suspect
that the candidates did not possess British English as first
language were excluded.  ...

     'Each script was scrutinised for errors by  two  people
working  independently.   ...   In  searching for errors the
scrutineers were instructed to record any word that deviated
from  the spelling of the Oxford Concise English Dictionary.
Apparent errors which could be  attributed  to  poor  letter
formation rather than wrong letters were not included;  this
exclusion  was  particularly  relevant  to  practices  of  a
shorthand  nature  such  as  contraction  of  'ing'  into  a
downward squiggle.  A deviation was recognised even  if  the
error  had  been  corrected by the candidate.  In such cases
the erroneous  version  was  recorded  as  the  sequence  of
letters up to the point at which the correction was made.

     'For every  error,  the  scrutineer  noted  the  target
intended  by  the  candidate,  the three words preceding the
error and the three words  following  the  error.   ...   In
addition  ..  the scrutineers were required to classify each
error as a slip or as a  convention  error.   An  error  was
categorised  as  a slip if (a) it was changed to the correct
spelling or (b) if uncorrected, the correct form of the word
occurred  at  least once elsewhere in the script.  Otherwise
the  error  was  categorised  as  a  convention  error.   [A
'convention  error' is the kind of error produced by someone
who is unsure of the correct spelling.  - RM.]

     'The two lists of errors for each script  were  checked
against the script by the first author [Dr Wing] as he keyed
them into magnetic disc storage  files  on  a  computer.   A



                                                      Page 2


computer  print-out  of the corpus was subsequently given to
the scrutineer who had worked through the  majority  of  the
scripts  and  she checked it for errors against the original
scripts.

     ...

     In the file, the spelling errors  are  'separated  into
two classes:  slips (Type 1) and convention errors (Type 2).
Within   this   classification   each   candidate's   errors
(including  targets and context) are grouped together in the
sequence in which they occurred in  the  script.   For  each
error  the  erroneous  form of the word is given first as it
was written up to the break in the written  trace  at  which
the error was corrected, if a correction was attempted.  The
target form  of  the  word  is  then  given.   If  shown  in
parentheses, no correction was attempted by the candidate.

     'When the target for a Type 1 error is shown misspelled
this  indicates  a  slip  was  made  in  producing  a Type 2
(convention) error.  The latter would thus  also  be  listed
under  Type 2 errors [unless it occurred elsewhere correctly
spelled].  Some of the Type 2  targets  not  in  parentheses
appear   misspelled.    This   indicates  that  the  initial
misspelled version was changed,  but  to  another  incorrect
form of the word as shown.

     'The  context  comprises  the   three   words   written
immediately  before  the  error  and the three words written
immediately after the error separated  by  a  '*'.   In  the
context  letters  or  words in parentheses indicate items in
the script deleted by the candidate.  Punctuation marks  are
not  indicated although sentence boundaries are identifiable
by the initial capital letter.  The abbreviations SQ and  EQ
stand  for  start  and  end  of  the candidate's answer to a
question.'




     The file WING.DAT differs slightly from  the  published
version  of  the  corpus.  The lines that begin each section
(Type 1 and Type 2)  and  the  lines  with  the  candidates'
serial  numbers  now  all  begin  with  a '$'.  Lines in the
original file were a maximum of 65  characters  long,  which
made  some of the contexts overrun onto a second line;  each
entry now fits on one line - the longest is 91 characters.

     Users  of  this  file  should  note  the  emphasis   on
handwriting  slips.   Many  of the error forms in the Type 1
section are fragments of words rather than  spelling  errors
in  the  ordinary  sense.  For example, if a candidate began
writing 'benefit' as 'bef' and then stopped, crossed out the
'bef' and wrote 'benefit', this is recorded in the file as:



                                                      Page 3


bef benefit

If he did not correct it, but indicated  that  he  knew  the
correct  spelling  by  writing  it correctly elsewhere, this
would appear as:

bef (benefit)

in the Type 1 section.  If he wrote 'bef' for 'benefit'  and
did not correct it and did not write it correctly elsewhere,
it would be counted as a convention error and appear in  the
Type 2 section.

     Users should also note that the 'target', when  not  in
parentheses,   is   the  letter-string  that  the  candidate
intended to write, not necessarily the correct spelling.  In
fact,  in  some  of  the  Type  2  errors, the candidate had
already written the correct spelling but  changed  it  to  a
wrong spelling, thus giving rise to entries such as:

acquire aquire

where 'acquire' (the 'error-form') is how it was  before  he
'corrected'  it and 'aquire' is the target - what he changed
it to.
