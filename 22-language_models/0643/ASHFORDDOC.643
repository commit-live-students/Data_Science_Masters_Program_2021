     ASHFORD.DAT contains the text of the novel  'The  Young
Visiters'  (sic)  by  Daisy  Ashford.  It is taken (with the
publisher's permission) from the edition first published  by
Chatto  and  Windus  in  1919.  The particular copy used was
printed in 1983;  ISBN 0 7011 0515 1.  It was input via  the
Kurzweil   Data  Entry  Machine  of  the  Oxford  University
Computing Service.

     The novel was written by a nine-year old in the  latter
half  of  the  nineteenth  century.   J.M.   Barrie,  in his
introduction to this edition, says:

     'The  owner  of  the  copyright  [ie   Daisy   Ashford]
guarantees  that The Young Visiters is the unaided effort in
fiction of an authoress of nine years.  ..   The  manuscript
is  in  pencil  in  a stout little note book (twopence), and
there it has lain for years, for though  the  authoress  was
nine  when  she wrote it she is now a grown woman.  ...  The
pencilled MS.  has been accurately reproduced,  not  a  word
added or cut out.  Each chapter being in one long paragraph,
however, this has been subdivided for the reader's comfort.'

     Chatto and Windus have  a  photocopy  of  the  original
manuscript  - the original is in the New York Public Library
- which they allowed me to have a look at.  The  writing  is
quite  readable,  though  the  photocopy  is not very clear.
There are some rubbings-out and corrections,  presumably  by
Daisy  herself.   Some  of  Daisy's  errors  are handwriting
slips, such as 'fliglty' for 'flighty';  at other places  it
is  simply  not  clear  what  she  wrote  -  her spelling of
'journey' could be taken in various ways.

     Comparing the first few pages of  the  manuscript  with
the published version revealed a few discrepancies but not a
lot.  Some of Daisy's errors have been  corrected,  such  as
'cushion'  for 'cushon';  some words that she got right have
been printed with errors, such as 'lovly' for 'lovely',  and
occasionally   a  misspelling  has  been  printed  which  is
different from Daisy's, such  as  'cariage'  for  'carrage'.
Some  changes  have  been  made, I suspect, to maintain some
consistency;  for example, Daisy writes 'rarther' in Chapter
1  and  'rather'  in  Chapter  2,  but the published version
retains 'rarther'.  I was told that Chatto are intending  to
bring  out  a  new  edition  and that this new one will stay
closer to the spelling in the original manuscript.

     Sections in the file marked by '<1' and '>1' are  parts
that were in italics in the book.
