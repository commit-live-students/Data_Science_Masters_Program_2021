     The file CHES.DAT contains the misspellings of 30 words
produced  by  202  10-year-old children in a dictation test.
They were made available to  me  by  Dr  Uta  Frith  of  the
Medical  Research  Council's  Cognitive Development Unit, 17
Gordon Street, London WC1H 0AH.  The following extracts  are
from 'Specific spelling problems' by Uta Frith, published in
'Dyslexia:  A Global Issue', ed  R.N.   Malatesha  and  H.A.
Whitaker,  in  the  NATO  ASI  series,  by  Martinus Nijhoff
Publishers, 1984, pp 83-103.

     'The Child Health and Education  Study  is  a  national
longitudinal  survey  of  children  born between 5th to 11th
April, 1970.  A follow-up study of 15,000 children has  just
been  carried  out.   The children were aged 10 to 11 at the
time of testing.  It is important to  point  out  that  this
comprises  the  total  population  of  children  in England,
Scotland and Wales.  All regions, rural and urban districts,
all   classes,   all  types  of  schooling,  were  therefore
represented.  This follow-up of the CHES cohort was  carried
out  by  a  team under Professor Neville Butler with Dr Mary
Haslum.' ....

     'The ..  sample (of 202) was a random  sample  selected
from children with names across the whole alphabet.'

     'Word spelling:  This test was dictation of  a  passage
which  contained  30  words  (15  regular  and 15 irregular)
selected from Schonell's  lists  of  regular  and  irregular
words  (Schonell,  1942).   ....   Included  halfway  in the
dictated passage were four non-words.  ....  All  tests  had
been   administered   individually  by  the  children's  own
teachers.'

     These are the instructions given to the teachers:

     'Please dictate the following to the child, at a  speed
suited  to the child's pace of writing.  If the child cannot
write a word and asks how to spell it, say:   'Just  try  to
write   it  as  best  you  can,'  and  repeat  the  sentence
containing the problem word.  Do  not  repeat  a  particular
sentence  more  than once.  However, if the child asks for a
repetition of the imaginary  words  in  the  middle  of  the
passage, those words may be repeated twice.'

     'I OFTEN VISITED my AUNT.  She lived in  a  MAGNIFICENT
HOUSE  OPPOSITE the GALLERY.  I REMEMBER her SPLENDID PURPLE
CURTAINS.  She WROTE POETRY.  The PROBLEM was  nobody  could
UNDERSTAND  it.   Her  LATEST  POEMS  had words like prunty,
slimber, grondel, blomp.  I WANTED to LAUGH  but  I  had  to
PRETEND  to  like  them.  However, I REALLY like the SPECIAL
REFRESHMENT.  THERE was BLUE JUICE, CAKE and BISCUITS.  When
I left, my STOMACH was full and I was happy and CONTENTED.'

     The thirty test words are the  ones  in  capitals  (not
counting  'I').  The misspellings of these words were copied
out from the children's scripts by Stephanie Fenton.  It  is
these  copied-out  versions  that  were keyed in.  (The four
nonwords were not keyed in.) The  copied-out  versions  were
all  in  upper-case,  though  it is likely that the children
used a mixture of upper- and lower-case.  They were keyed in
entirely in lower-case.

     Each child begins a new line with his/her  CHES  serial
number.   The  words  are  numbered 1 to 30.  '..' indicates
that the child omitted the word.  A continuation line begins
with  a  '+'.   Each  case ends with a '!'.  A '*' after the
serial number means that the child got all the words  right.
A  few serial numbers end with /1 or /2 (eg 07706);  I think
these are twins.
