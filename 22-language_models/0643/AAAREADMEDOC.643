OF ENGLISH SPELLING ERRORS (Version 2, 1986)


     This document describes a collection of  computer-readable  files
containing  misspellings of English words.  The collection was made as
part of a research project in the Department of  Computer  Science  of
Birkbeck  College,  London.   The project was funded by the Leverhulme
Trust; a grant towards the data input was made by the Central Research
Fund of the University of London.  An earlier collection, described in
"A  Collection  of  Computer-readable  corpora  of  English   spelling
errors",  Cognitive  Neuropsychology,  1985,  2  (3) 275-279, was made
available in 1985.  The present collection  incorporates  the  earlier
one.

     The collection is made  available  for  research.   It  would  be
appreciated  if  researchers  who  use any of this material would make
some acknowledgement both of the collection and, where appropriate, of
the suppliers of the original corpora.

Introduction

     The collection  is  divided  into  two  parts.   Nearly  all  the
misspellings  in  the  first  part were produced by native speakers of
English, most of them British though three files contain  misspellings
produced  by  Americans;  those in the second part are from non-native
speakers.   Most  of  the  misspellings  are   spelling   errors,   ie
misspellings  produced  by  people  who  were  not sure of the correct
spelling, rather than slips in typing or  handwriting.   Some  of  the
misspellings  were  collected  in spelling tests or dictations, others
from free writing.  Some are from children, others from  adults;  some
are from people receiving special tuition in reading and writing.

     The task of gathering together these error corpora was undertaken
as  part  of  a  research  project  into  the design of a computerised
spelling corrector for poor spellers; the main purpose was to indicate
the  range  of  problems that such a corrector would have to cope with
and to provide a  substantial  quantity  of  data  on  which  to  test
possible   methods  of  correction.   However,  I  expected  that  the
collection, once in computer-readable form, would be  of  interest  to
other  researchers  also,  and  I have therefore retained in the files
various items of information which are not of particular  interest  to
me but which may be of more interest to others.

     I have not collected any of  this  material  at  first  hand;  it
already existed in one form or another.  Some of it was already in the
form of computer-readable files; some was in published books; some had
been  partially analysed in the course of research, and some was still
in the form of scripts and test papers.  My contribution has  been  to
gather  these  corpora  together,  to put onto the computer those that
were not already in computer-readable form and to  write  descriptions
of  them.   The people who supplied me with the material have read and
approved these descriptions.

Part 1: Native speakers

     There are basically twelve sets of material from native  speakers
(two  more  than  in  the earlier collection), though some of them are
divided into more than one file, making  17  files  in  all.   A  more
detailed  description  of each of the files follows this introduction,
so I will give only a brief description here.  The first four came  to
me  in more-or-less raw form; the other eight were already in the form
of either files or books:

CHES

     Misspellings of thirty words by about 200  ten-year-old  children
in  England,  Wales and Scotland.  These children were a random sample
from the several thousand tested in the  Child  Health  and  Education
Survey (CHES) in 1980.

                                                                Page 3


NFER

     Misspellings made in two  short  dictations  by  about  80  adult
literacy  students  in  England  and  Wales  -  a sample from a survey
conducted by the National Foundation for Educational  Research  (NFER)
in 1978-79.

PERIN

     Three sets of material collected by Dr Dolores Perin in  research
conducted in the late 1970's:

1)  A  dictation  and  a  piece  of  constrained   writing   from   36
secondary-school leavers and from six adult-literacy students.

2) Misspellings from free writing by six adult-literacy students.

3) A spelling test of forty words from about 170  students  in  London
secondary schools.

PETERS

     Two samples of the material collected by Dr  Margaret  Peters  in
primary and secondary schools in Cambridge in the 1960's:

1)  Misspellings  from  about  150  children  in  spelling  tests  and
dictations  at  the ages of 9, 10 and 11, and in a spelling test and a
piece of free writing at age 15  (ie  each  child  at  four  different
ages).

2) Misspellings from short compositions by over 900 fifteen-year-olds.

ASHFORD

     The complete text of 'The Young Visiters' (sic) by Daisy Ashford,
a  short  novel  written  by a nine-year-old in Victorian England; the
text contains many of her original misspellings.

FAWTHROP

     Two files supplied in computer-readable form by  David  Fawthrop,
collected  in  the  course of his research into spelling correction at
Bradford University:

1) A compilation of four  collections  of  American  spelling  errors,
already in published form.

2) A collection of misspellings from  the  writing  of  three  British
people, all of whom considered themselves to be poor spellers.

GATES

     The most common misspellings of 3876 words  taken  from  spelling
tests  given  to  schoolchildren  in New York City in the 1930's; this
material was taken from the book 'A List of Spelling  Difficulties  in
3876 Words', by Arthur I.  Gates.

HOLBROOK

     Passages taken from the creative writing of about 20 children  in
a  British  secondary  school  in  the  1960's,  published (with their
original  misspellings)  in  'English  for  the  Rejected'  by   David
Holbrook.

MASTERS

     Misspellings of about 260 words made in  spelling  tests  by  600
students  in  Iowa  in  the  1920's - 200 8th graders, 200 high-school
seniors and 200 college seniors - collected by H.V.  Masters  for  his
PhD research.  This is the full set of data that he analysed, not just
the examples he included in his published report.

SHEFFIELD

     A list of about 380 misspellings,  mostly  keying  errors,  taken
from  typewritten or computer-terminal input, collected from staff and
students  in  the  Department  of  Information  Studies  of  Sheffield
University  by  Angell,  Freund  and  Willett  as  part  of a piece of
research into spelling correction.

UPWARD

     Misspellings taken from answers to a questionnaire  completed  by
about  160  15-year-olds  in Nottingham.  The material was supplied by
Chris Upward of the Dept of Modern Languages, Aston University.

WING

     Misspellings (mainly handwriting slips) from essays written by 40
candidates  in the Cambridge University Entrance Examinations in 1976.
This corpus was collected and put into computer-readable form by  Wing
and  Baddeley  and  is  described  in  their paper 'Spelling errors in
handwriting:  a corpus and a distributional analysis'.

Part 2: Non-native speakers

EXAMS

     Misspellings taken from scripts submitted in English examinations
by overseas students in 18 countries, with 50 or 100 scripts from each
country.  The scripts were made available for  this  exercise  by  the
University   of   Cambridge   Local  Examinations  Syndicate  and  the
University of London Schools Examinations Board.

ABO

     Misspellings   collected   from   Finnish-speaking   Finns    and
Swedish-speaking Finns in a series of tests conducted in the 1970's by
Dr Rolf Palmberg and Dr Hakan Ringbom of the Abo Akademi, Finland.

APPLING

     Two files of data (APPLING1 and APPLING2) collected  by  students
of  the  Applied  Linguistics  Department  of  Birkbeck College in the
course of their work as teachers of English.

BLOOR

     Errors taken from a corpus of  written  English  by  12  Algerian
students.  The file was supplied by Meriel Bloor of the Dept of Modern
Languages, Aston University.

SUOMI

     Errors taken from test papers written by 60 Finnish speakers  and
45  Swedish  speakers  aged  15-16  years.   The data formed part of a
thesis submitted by Riitta Suomi at the Abo Akademi, Finland.

TELEMARK

     Errors taken from examination  papers  written  by  145  advanced
Norwegian  students of English at Telemark College, Norway.  They were
recorded in a study by Dr Nils Rottingen.

TESDELL

     Errors from 56 students taking an  English  Language  Proficiency
Test  at Iowa State University in 1981-82.  The material was collected
by Lee S.  Tesdell.


     The tape produced by the Birkbeck College computer is written  on
a  VAX 11/750 under VMS, ANSI-labelled (the tape label is SPELL), 1600
bpi, ASCII.  All the lines have been padded out with  spaces  to  make
100 bytes per record and 2000 bytes per block.  All the data files are
text files containing only printable ASCII characters.  The full  list
of files on the tape is as follows:

     The preparation of material for data-entry,  and  the  subsequent
keying-in,  involved  a  good  deal of work.  The bulk of the clerical
work was carried out by Philip Baker and John and Kate Murray, and the
keying-in by the Lin Bailey, Sheila Hailey and Barbara Whitmore of the
Data  Preparation  Service  of  Birkbeck  College.   The  Ashford  and
Holbrook  books  were input via the Kurzweil Data Entry Machine of the
Oxford University Computing Services.

     I have run various programs to check the files and have corrected
such  errors  as  these  have  thrown  up.  I think that the files are
reasonably free of errors introduced in the  process  of  transferring
the  material onto the computer, but I obviously cannot guarantee that
there are none at all.

     There follows a detailed description of each of the files.   Each
description  begins  with a copy of the first ten lines, in order that
users may match up the descriptions with the files that they refer to.

  <1QUITE A YOUNG GIRL>1

MR SALTEENA was an elderly man of 42 and was fond
of asking peaple to stay with him.  He had quite a young
girl staying with him of 17 named Ethel Monticue.  Mr
Salteena had dark short hair and mustache and wiskers
which were very black and twisty.  He was middle sized
and he had very pale blue eyes.  He had a pale brown


     ASHFORD.DAT contains the text of the novel 'The  Young  Visiters'
(sic) by Daisy Ashford.  It is taken (with the publisher's permission)
from the edition first published by Chatto and Windus  in  1919.   The
particular  copy used was printed in 1983; ISBN 0 7011 0515 1.  It was
input via the Kurzweil Data Entry Machine  of  the  Oxford  University
Computing Service.

     The novel was written by a nine-year old in the  latter  half  of
the  nineteenth  century.   J.M.   Barrie, in his introduction to this
edition, says:

     'The owner of the copyright [ie Daisy  Ashford]  guarantees  that
The Young Visiters is the unaided effort in fiction of an authoress of
nine years.  ..  The manuscript is in pencil in a  stout  little  note
book  (twopence),  and  there  it  has  lain for years, for though the
authoress was nine when she wrote it she is now a  grown  woman.   ...
The pencilled MS.  has been accurately reproduced, not a word added or
cut out.  Each chapter being in one long paragraph, however, this  has
been subdivided for the reader's comfort.'

     Chatto and Windus have a photocopy of the original  manuscript  -
the original is in the New York Public Library - which they allowed me
to have a  look  at.   The  writing  is  quite  readable,  though  the
photocopy  is  not  very  clear.   There  are  some  rubbings-out  and
corrections, presumably by Daisy herself.  Some of Daisy's errors  are
handwriting slips, such as 'fliglty' for 'flighty'; at other places it
is simply not clear what she wrote - her spelling of  'journey'  could
be taken in various ways.

     Comparing  the  first  few  pages  of  the  manuscript  with  the
published version revealed a few discrepancies but not a lot.  Some of
Daisy's errors have been corrected, such as  'cushion'  for  'cushon';
some  words  that she got right have been printed with errors, such as
'lovly' for 'lovely', and occasionally a misspelling has been  printed
which  is  different  from  Daisy's,  such as 'cariage' for 'carrage'.
Some changes have been made, I suspect, to maintain some  consistency;
for  example,  Daisy  writes  'rarther'  in  Chapter 1 and 'rather' in
Chapter 2, but the published version retains 'rarther'.   I  was  told
that Chatto are intending to bring out a new edition and that this new

one will stay closer to the spelling in the original manuscript.

     Sections in the file marked by '<1' and '>1' are parts that  were
in italics in the book.

     The file CHES.DAT contains the misspellings of 30 words  produced
by  202  10-year-old  children  in  a  dictation test.  They were made
available to me by Dr Uta Frith  of  the  Medical  Research  Council's
Cognitive  Development  Unit,  17 Gordon Street, London WC1H 0AH.  The
following extracts are from 'Specific spelling problems' by Uta Frith,
published  in 'Dyslexia:  A Global Issue', ed R.N.  Malatesha and H.A.
Whitaker, in the NATO ASI  series,  by  Martinus  Nijhoff  Publishers,
1984, pp 83-103.

     'The Child Health and Education Study is a national  longitudinal
survey  of children born between 5th to 11th April, 1970.  A follow-up
study of 15,000 children has just been carried out.  The children were
aged  10  to  11 at the time of testing.  It is important to point out
that this comprises the  total  population  of  children  in  England,
Scotland  and  Wales.   All  regions,  rural  and urban districts, all
classes, all types of schooling,  were  therefore  represented.   This
follow-up of the CHES cohort was carried out by a team under Professor
Neville Butler with Dr Mary Haslum.' ....

     'The ..  sample (of  202)  was  a  random  sample  selected  from
children with names across the whole alphabet.'

     'Word spelling:  This test  was  dictation  of  a  passage  which
contained  30  words  (15  regular  and  15  irregular)  selected from
Schonell's lists of regular  and  irregular  words  (Schonell,  1942).
....   Included  halfway  in the dictated passage were four non-words.
....  All tests had been administered individually by  the  children's
own teachers.'

     These are the instructions given to the teachers:

     'Please dictate the following to the child, at a speed suited  to
the  child's  pace  of  writing.  If the child cannot write a word and
asks how to spell it, say:  'Just try to write it as  best  you  can,'
and  repeat the sentence containing the problem word.  Do not repeat a
particular sentence more than once.  However, if the child asks for  a
repetition  of the imaginary words in the middle of the passage, those
words may be repeated twice.'

                                                               Page 10


     'I OFTEN VISITED my AUNT.   She  lived  in  a  MAGNIFICENT  HOUSE
OPPOSITE  the  GALLERY.  I REMEMBER her SPLENDID PURPLE CURTAINS.  She
WROTE POETRY.  The PROBLEM was nobody could UNDERSTAND it.  Her LATEST
POEMS  had  words  like  prunty, slimber, grondel, blomp.  I WANTED to
LAUGH but I had to PRETEND to like them.  However, I REALLY  like  the
SPECIAL REFRESHMENT.  THERE was BLUE JUICE, CAKE and BISCUITS.  When I
left, my STOMACH was full and I was happy and CONTENTED.'

     The thirty test words are the  ones  in  capitals  (not  counting
'I').   The  misspellings  of  these  words  were  copied out from the
children's scripts  by  Stephanie  Fenton.   It  is  these  copied-out
versions  that  were keyed in.  (The four nonwords were not keyed in.)
The copied-out versions were all in upper-case, though  it  is  likely
that  the children used a mixture of upper- and lower-case.  They were
keyed in entirely in lower-case.

     Each child begins a new line with  his/her  CHES  serial  number.
The words are numbered 1 to 30.  '..' indicates that the child omitted
the word.  A continuation line begins with a '+'.  Each case ends with
a '!'.  A '*' after the serial number means that the child got all the
words right.  A few serial numbers end with /1 or  /2  (eg  07706);  I
think these are twins.

University.  They are described in the paper 'The  rules  of  spelling
errors'   by   E.J.    Yannakoudakis  and  D.   Fawthrop,  Information
Processing and Management, Vol 19 No 2, 1983, pages 87-99.

     FAWTHROP1.DAT is the one that Fawthrop calls the 'typical'  file.
It is a list of 809 misspellings taken from four American sources:

Lasky J.  Proof-reading and Copy Preparation, Mentor Press, New  York,
1941, pages 84-131

Damerau F.J.  'A technique for computer detection  and  correction  of
spelling errors', CACM 1964 Vol 7 No 3, pages 171-176, Table 1

American  English,  Brown  University  Press, Providence Rhode Island,

Iowa,  1927  (The  errors recorded in FAWTHROP1 are those that Masters
gives as examples in his published report.  The full set of data  that
Masters collected is in the file MASTERS.DAT.)

     Each line consists of the correct spelling in  the  first  twenty
columns  followed  by  the  misspelling  in  the  next  twenty, all in
upper-case.  The 'correct' spelling was that which the original source

considered   to  be  correct,  or  the  one  in  Webster's  Third  New
International Dictionary,  1961.   In  either  case,  it  was  correct
American spelling rather than British.

     FAWTHROP2.DAT is the one  Fawthrop  calls  the  'bad'  file.   It
contains  560  misspellings taken from some 60,000 words of continuous
text written by three adults at the University of  Bradford,  each  of
them  with  a Northern English dialect, who all believed themselves to
be very bad spellers.   The  task  of  finding  the  misspellings  was
carried out by an ex-schoolteacher.  The 'correct' spelling here means
the one given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary  with  addenda,
1959.   The  format  of  the file is like that of FAWTHROP1.DAT except
that the misspelling occupies columns 21 to 38, and columns 39 and  40
contain  the  number  of  times  that each misspelling occurred in the
60,000 words of text.

     The file GATES.DAT contains all the  data  relating  to  spelling
from  the  book  'A  List  of  Spelling Difficulties in 3876 Words' by
Arthur I.  Gates, published by the Bureau  of  Publications,  Teachers
College,  Columbia University, New York City, 1937.  The following are
extracts from the book's introduction:

     'This  monograph  includes  several  types  of   pertinent   data
concerning  each of 3,876 words commonly taught in spelling courses in
American schools.  The experimental and statistical work was conducted
over  a number of years beginning in 1928.  The steps in the work were
as follows.

     'A list of "most commonly taught" words was  first  drawn  up  by
determining the frequency with which the words appeared in twenty-five
different widely used spelling textbooks,  and  state  and  large-city
spelling  lists.   From  this  distribution  the  words appearing most
frequently  were  selected.   The  limitation  to  3,876   words   was
arbitrary.   It  should  be  noted  that  this is a list of words most
frequently chosen by those who make  up  the  textbooks  and  spelling
lists,  and  it  therefore  doubtless  includes  the  3,876 words most
frequently taught in American classrooms.  The present author makes no
claim that this is the best list of words to teach.  It is, however, a
list which spelling experts believe to be best.   No  claim  is  made,
furthermore,  that  3,876  words is the optimum number to teach.  This
number, however, is close to the average number contained in the lists
and texts studied.

     'Many words in this list were placed at different grade levels in
the  various  texts  and state or city lists.  The mean of these grade
placements was computed for each word, and is entered in the  list  in
this  monograph.   [This  information is not included in GATES.DAT.  -
R.M.] The author makes no claim that these mean grade  placements  are
ideal.   They  indicate approximately the grade placement at which the
words are most commonly introduced in American schools.

                                                               Page 14


     'The most  important  part  of  the  monograph  is  the  evidence
concerning the characteristics of errors in spelling each of the 3,876
words.  To obtain these data the words were used in spelling tests  in
which  the responses were made in writing.  The words were pronounced,
used in a sentence or two to define the meaning, pronounced again, and
then written by the pupils.  The subjects for the tests were pupils in
various public schools in the metropolitan area, mainly from Manhattan
and  Brooklyn.  Each word was usually given to a class one grade lower
than the grade in which the  word  was  formerly  [I  think  he  means
'formally' - R.M.] taught in the curriculum of this particular school.
This policy was  adopted  in  order  to  secure  a  larger  number  of
misspellings  than  would  have  been forthcoming after the pupils had
studied the word.  That is to say, for most  pupils  misspellings  are
instances  of  failure to solve a spelling problem rather than failure
to recall  a  practiced  spelling.   This,  of  course,  will  not  be
universally  true.   Many  children write words, look them up in books
and dictionaries, and study  them  before  encountering  them  in  the
spelling program.

     'In the Spelling List beginning  on  page  11  the  first  column
consists of the word correctly spelled, followed by one, two, or three
figures in parentheses.  It will be noted that certain letters in most
words  are in italics and that in some words two parts of the word are
italicized, or that one part is italicized and another part appears in
bold  face  letters.   (Bold  face  is  used  when  the two parts come
together, so that they may be easily distinguished.) The part  of  the
word  italicized  or  in  bold  face is the part in which the greatest
number of errors are made.  If the word has two parts  italicized,  or
one  part  italicized and another part in bold face, it means that two
parts are especially hard.  The figure or figures in italics give  the
actual  percentages.   For  example,  in the first word "ability", the
largest number of errors consist of failures on the second "i",  which
is  italicized.   The  figure in parentheses indicates that 61% of the
misspellings of this word are failures on the "i".  In the second word
"able",  91%  of  the  errors  are  on  the  letters  "le",  which are
italicized.  In the word "abundance", the hard spots are the  "u"  and
the  second  "a",  both  of  which  are  italicized.   In  48%  of the
misspellings there is an error on the "u" and in 73% the error  is  on
the  second "a".  In the word "absent", the two hard spots are the "b"
and the "s", the first of which, showing 38%  errors,  is  italicized,
and  the  second  of  which, showing 43% errors, is in bold face.  The
second hard spot is given in bold face to indicate that it  is  to  be
thought of as separate from the preceding letter "b" in italics, which
is also a hard spot.  In this word the "b" and  the  "s"  are  treated
separately,  or  as  representing  two hard spots, for the reason that
they fall into different syllables and are commonly treated  as  parts
of  two units within the word.  In the word "acquaintance", with three
hard spots, the percentage of the total number of errors in each  case
is  given.  In certain cases, the hard spot is indicated by letters in
parentheses above or beside a word.  Thus, in "appears", an  "(e)"  is
placed  above the space between the last two letters.  This means that
the hard spot is this space - the result of inserting an "e".  In  the
case  of  "avoid", an "(e)" follows the word and means that the ending
of the word, due to a tendency to add an "e", is a hard spot.

                                                               Page 15


     'The second column of the Spelling List  gives  the  most  common
misspelling  of  the  word,  and  the third column the per cent of the
total errors which this particular misspelling represents.   Thus,  in
the  case  of "ability", the most common misspelling is "abilaty".  Of
all the errors made on this word, 41.9% take exactly this form.   This
word  is spelled "abbility" in 22.6% of the cases.  That is to say, of
all the misspellings of this word, 64.5% are one or the other of these
two  forms.  The second word "able" shows only one common misspelling,
namely "abel", which accounts for 35.1%  of  the  total  misspellings.
The  third  word,  "aboard",  has no misspelling which appears clearly
more frequently than others.  This word is obviously spelled  a  great
many  different  ways, although, as the first column shows, 59% of the
errors reveal difficulties in "oa".

     'The number of misspellings analyzed differs from word  to  word,
but in no case is it less than 200.  The median number of misspellings
per word is slightly over 300, and for about a quarter  of  the  words
the   number   exceeds  400.   It  is  believed  that  the  number  of
misspellings, even at the minimum, is  sufficient  to  give  a  fairly
reliable  result.  For all the words, more than 1,200,000 misspellings
were analyzed.

....

     'It should be noted that, although the  data  in  this  monograph
were  obtained  from  a large number of cases, they may, nevertheless,
not present an entirely accurate picture of the facts  that  would  be
found  in  other  localities.   It  is possible, for example, that the
spelling errors are conditioned somewhat by the time  and  methods  of
teaching  words,  by  the  frequency  with which the words are used in
writing, and  by  the  typical  pronunciation  of  a  given  locality.
Children  habitually  using the characteristic speech of Boston, or of
Portland, Maine, or of New Orleans, or of Houston, Texas,  may  reveal
somewhat  different  forms  of  misspelling.   In  this  monograph  no
endeavour  has  been  made  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the
misspellings  differ  as  the  result  of these and other factors.  It
should be realized, however, that the population of the schools in New
York  City  is  extremely  diversified  and that all forms of language
background are represented.  It is believed  that  the  list  gives  a
reasonably  representative picture of misspellings, although it is not
denied that children living in quite different localities or  speaking
quite  different dialects might differ somewhat in their spelling from
any representative list.'




     Each line of GATES.DAT  begins  with  the  word  correctly  spelt
(correctly  according to American spelling, that is - 'color', 'honor'
and the like).  In Gates's book (as explained in the above  extracts),
the 'hard spots' are marked by italics or bold letters.  In GATES.DAT,
this aspect of the data is represented by the words beginning with  $.
For  example,  in  Gates's  text,  the  second  'i'  of  'ability'  is
italicized and the word is followed by  '(61)',  meaning  (in  Gates's
words)  that '61% of the misspellings of this word are failures on the

                                                               Page 16


"i".' In GATES.DAT, the second 'i' is  capitalized,  so  the  word  is
shown   as   '$abilIty 61'.   Where  Gates  uses  a  small  letter  in
parentheses above the word or at the end of the word, to indicate that
the  children  tended  to  insert  a  letter  at that point, GATES.DAT
contains a '%' in the $  word.   For  example,  Gates's  'aid(e)'  and
'a(r)larm' are given as '$aid%' and '$a%larm'.

     The most common misspellings are given in GATES.DAT by the  words
beginning  with  '*'.   For example, 'abbility' accounted for 22.6% of
all the misspellings of 'ability', and 'abilaty' for 41.9%.   This  is
shown  as '*abbility 23' and '*abilaty 42'.  (Note that Gates does not
give the proportion of children who spelled the word correctly.)

     A few words, such as 'America'  and  'Christmas',  are  correctly
spelt  with  an  initial  capital letter.  To avoid confusion with the
capitals that have been  used  in  GATES.DAT  to  indicate  the  'hard
spots',  these  words have been spelt with initial lower-case letters,
ie 'america' and 'christmas'.

     Some of the headwords are actually two words, eg 'all right'  and
'santa  claus'.   To  indicate  that  they are to be taken as a single
item,  they  are  joined  in  GATES.DAT  by  a  single  underline,  eg
'all_right'.

     Some of the words in Gates's book are  listed  without  any  hard
spots  and  without  any  common  misspellings,  eg  'all'.   They are
included in GATES.DAT merely for completeness.

     There is one place where the percentage was  omitted  in  Gates's
book,  namely  for  the  hard  spot  in "I'd"; a figure of 00 has been
inserted here.

     It would be nice to know the ages of the children who were tested
on  each  word,  but this information is not provided.  Presumably the
easier words were tested on younger children and the  harder  ones  on
older  children.   From  the  figures  that Gates gives for mean grade
placement of each word in the spelling lists (these  figures  are  not
included in GATES.DAT), it can be estimated that the youngest children
were aged about 7 and the oldest about 13.  However, since words  were
probably  introduced  at  different  grades  in different schools, the
children tested on any particular  word  will  have  been  drawn  from
different grades and therefore been of different ages.

     Gates does not say who administered the tests or who marked  them
and  classified them.  However, I have had some correspondence with Dr
Leonard Wheat, who was one of  Gates's  research  assistants  on  this
study  in  the  year  1930-31.   He  tells  me  that  the  tests  were
administered  by  the   children's   schoolteachers,   after   careful
instruction  by the research staff.  The teachers made use of the test
results, but  all  tests  were  evaluated  promptly  by  the  research
assistants.   (Dr  Wheat  also confirmed that, though the scripts were
kept for several years, it is unlikely that they still exist.)

     The file has one line  for  each  of  Gates's  test  words.   The
version  on tape has each line padded out with spaces to 95 characters
- the length of the longest line plus 1.

     The passages in HOLBROOK.DAT are taken from the book 'English for
the  Rejected'  by  David  Holbrook, Cambridge University Press, 1964.
They are extracts from the writings of  children  in  class  3C  of  a
secondary   school;  the  children  were  aged  13  or  14,  in  their
next-to-last year of schooling.  In a  couple  of  the  passages,  the
children  were copying literary material supplied to them, but all the
rest is their own writing.  The passages appear in the section 'Sparks
from  a  Different  Element',  pages  44-187.  They are linked, in the
book, by description, explanation and comment by Holbrook, and some of
them make little sense without that context.

     Holbrook introduces this section of the book as follows:

     'In this section I discuss the development  towards  literacy  of
nineteen  children  in  one  'C'  stream  class  in a secondary modern
school, child by child.  This section is intended to convince  readers
of  four  main contentions.  First, that so-called 'backward' children
are not inferior beings, but are in fact  sensitive,  perceptive,  and
full   of   deep   feelings,   ambitions  and  capacities  for  making
contributions to human life and culture.  Second, that the best way to
make them literate, in the fullest sense, is by imaginative work; that
this is well within the capacities of any teacher.  Third,  that  half
the  trouble  with  'backward' children is that they feel rejected and
despised by teachers, the school and society - and that the  fact  is,
unhappily, that they are so despised.  Finally, that an important part
of our work with them must be devoted to curing them of the effects of
feelings of failure.'

     Holbrook, who was the children's English teacher,  preserved  the
original  spelling  and  punctuation  when  he  typed the passages for
publication.  The passages contain occasional words in square brackets
giving  Holbrook's  interpretation  of  what  the  child  meant.   The
children are given  fictitious  names  in  the  book,  and  these  are
retained  in  HOLBROOK.DAT,  together  with page references, to enable
people using this material to relate it to the book.

     MASTERS.DAT contains most of the data collected by H.V.   Masters
in  his  research into spelling in Iowa in the 1920's.  His own report
on it was published as "A Study of  Spelling  Errors",  University  of
Iowa Studies in Education Vol IV No 4, 1927.

     He took the commonest 5000 words  from  Ernest  Horn's  "A  Basic
Writing  Vocabulary" and selected those that were misspelled by 40% or
more of 8th grade pupils, according to an earlier study  by  Ashbaugh.
In short, the test words were fairly common but fairly hard.  (Some of
the words are not at all common in  British  use,  such  as  "alumni",
"sorority"  and  -  a word new to me - "Chautauqua".) He put these 268
words into a spelling test, with most of the words being read  out  in
isolation  but some of them necessarily in a sentence of context (such
as "customer's").  The  tests  were  sent  out  to  high  schools  and
colleges  in  Iowa  where  they  were  administered  by  the students'
teachers.  The tests were given to  8th  grade  students,  high-school
seniors  and  college seniors.  Masters took a random sample of 200 of
the returned scripts at each grade-level.

     In his published report, Masters gives summary statistics for all
the   words   plus   detailed   results  for  just  three  of  them  -
"accommodate", "dropped" and "pneumonia".  However, he also notes that
the  full  list of all the misspellings of all the words is on file in
the University Library.  I obtained a microfilm of this list  and  had
the  misspellings  of all except four of the test words keyed into the
computer.  (The omitted words were "cooperate",  "coupe"  and  "role",
which  Masters  spelt  with  diacritics, and "despair", which got lost
somewhere along the line.  Incidentally, word 253 in his list in Table
6 (page 27) is "transferred" and not, as he gives, "transformed".)

     Each section of the file begins with  the  correct  spelling  (as
given by Masters) preceded by a $ sign and followed by six numbers, eg

$absurd 85 172 194 115 28 6

The first three numbers give the number of correct spellings  produced
by  the  8th  graders, the high-school seniors and the college seniors
respectively.  (These sometimes include the number of corrrectly spelt
derived  forms,  such  as  "affectionately"  for  "affectionate".) The
second three numbers give the number of  incorrect  plus  unattempted.

                                                               Page 21


Then  follows  the  list  of all the misspellings of this word, in the
order given by Masters.  Each of these is followed by  three  numbers,
being the number of students who produced this particular misspelling,
for 8th graders, high-school seniors and college seniors respectively.

     If a spelling or misspelling contains a space, this is  given  as
an  underline,  eg  "all_right".   For a few of the spellings, Masters
accepted these alternatives as correct:   "basket_ball",  "cancelled",
"cancelling", "catalogs" and "judgement".  Derived forms which Masters
accepted as almost correct have an asterisk after the third number  on
the line.

     Masters'  definition  of  a   misspelling   was   quite   severe;
"Catalogues"  for  "catalogues"  (upper-case  "C" for lower-case), for
example, is counted as a misspelling.  In a few places he  included  a
correct  spelling  in  the list of misspellings.  It seems likely that
these were misspellings that he copied incorrectly into his report.  I
have removed them from the file.  They were as follows:

     These two files of data were obtained from a survey conducted  by
the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER).

     The file NFER1.DAT contains a random sample of 83  cases  from  a
survey  of  students  in  Adult  Literacy schemes in England and Wales
undertaken in 1978-79  by  the  National  Foundation  for  Educational
Research.   A  short  report  of  the  survey is given in 'A survey of
attainment and progress of learners in Adult Literacy schemes' by T.P.
Gorman  in  Educational  Research,  23,  3, June 1981 (pp 190-198).  A
longer report is held in the library of the NFER.  The address of  the
NFER is The Mere, Upton Park, Slough, Berks, SL1 2DQ, telephone Slough
74123.

     A sample of  41  Adult  Literacy  schemes,  stratified  by  size,
city-size and geographical area was drawn from a total of 141 schemes.
The following description is taken from the paper by Gorman:

     'The initial survey commenced in December 1978 and  continued  in
some  schemes  to  March 1979.  It involved a sample of 1,236 students
who had enrolled during the previous six months.  The sample comprised
about  six  per cent of the target population.  ...  The ratio of male
and female learners was approximately 2:1 (65.5 per cent  were  male).
Just  over  half  the  students (55.5 per cent) were between 21 and 40
years old.  Twenty-two per cent were under 21 and  23  per  cent  over
40.'

                                                               Page 23


     Several tests of reading and writing were given to the  students.
The tests were administered on a one-to-one basis by the students' own
tutors.  The tests were graded in increasing order of difficulty,  and
students  were  allowed  to drop out if they found a test unreasonably
difficult.  The data in NFER1.DAT was  taken  from  just  two  of  the
tests.

     For the first of these, the student was given a  sheet  of  lined
paper  with  'Dear  Mary,'  written  in the top left-hand corner.  The
tutor dictated this short letter which the student wrote down:

     'We will be coming to Leeds on Sunday with our two sons.  As  you
were not there last time we came, we are looking forward to seeing you
again.

                Best wishes, '

     For the second of these two tests, the student was given a  sheet
with  the  following  story  typed  on  it,  except  that the words in
capitals were replaced by underlined gaps.  The  tutor  read  out  the
story and the student wrote the words in the gaps:

     'My FRIENDS, Joan and Arthur live near the  STATION.   They  have
two  children,  both  still  BABIES.  Yesterday I WALKED over to their
house to help Arthur do some DIGGING.  I was a bit late because I  had
been  COOKING  myself  HALF  a  pound of steak and VARIOUS vegetables,
including fried POTATOES.  I am not used to DINING on so much, it must
be  ADMITTED,  but  I  had  RECEIVED a bonus that week and I wanted to
celebrate.  Arthur still had not dug very much of the  garden  when  I
got there .  In fact his progress was hardly NOTICEABLE.'

     The following results are taken  from  the  full  report  of  the
survey.   The  figures  indicate  the  percentage  spelling  the  word
correctly; for example, out of the  850  students  who  attempted  the
'Dear Mary' letter, 44% spelled 'coming' correctly.

'Dear Mary' letter: 70% (approx 850 students) took
this test:

coming     44%     our       43%     two       50%
sons       52%     were      42%     there     50%
forward    31%     seeing    59%     again     37%
wishes     36%

'Joan and Arthur' test: 60%  (approx 730 students)
took this test:

friends    24%     station   29%     babies    17%
walked     30%     digging   26%     cooking   48%
half       33%     various    8%     potatoes  21%
dining     23%     admitted  13%     received  10%
noticeable  8%

     The data for NFER1.DAT was taken from  a  random  sample  of  the
students'  scripts.   Only  the misspellings were recorded.  No record
was made if the student spelled a word correctly, and  no  record  was
made of omissions.  Each case begins with the student's serial number.
The misspellings are  then  listed,  each  preceded  by  a  number  to
indicate  which  word  it  was  a  misspelling  of,  according  to the
following key:

     1 we, 2 will, 3 be,  4 coming,  5 to,  6 leeds,  7 on,  8 sunday,
9 with,  10 our,  11 two,  12 sons,  13 as,  14 you,  15 were, 16 not,
17 there, 18 last, 19 time, 20 we, 21 came, 22 we, 23 are, 24 looking,
25 forward, 26 to, 27 seeing, 28 you, 29 again, 30 best, 31 wishes

51 friends, 52 station, 53 babies, 54 walked, 55 digging,  56 cooking,
57 half, 58 various, 59 potatoes, 60 dining, 61 admitted, 62 received,
63 noticeable

     Capital  letters  (right  or  wrong)  were  ignored.   Where  the
misspelling  contained a space (as in 'a gane' for 'again'), the space
has been underlined, eg 'a_gane'.

     If a case goes onto a second or subsequent line, the line  begins
with a '+', and each case ends with a '!'.

     The file NFER2.DAT is just like NFER1.DAT except that it contains
a  group  of  students  who were recorded in the follow-up survey (see
Gorman's paper for  details)  as  being  second-language  speakers  of
English.  No information about their first language was collected.

     The material in the files PERIN1.DAT, PERIN2.DAT  and  PERIN3.DAT
was  supplied  by Dr Dolores Perin, who is currently (1984) working at
the Center for Advanced Study in Education,  City  University  of  New
York, 33 West 42 Street, New York, N.Y.  10036.

     The first two files contain material collected in the  course  of
the  research she carried out in the late 1970's for her PhD at Sussex
University.  PERIN1.DAT contains the results of two tests given to  42
subjects,  these  42  being  made  up of 36 fifteen-year-old boys at a
secondary school and six men receiving Adult  Literacy  tuition.   The
following is from Dr Perin's PhD thesis:

     'The 36 boys were all pupils at  a  working  class  comprehensive
school  in Brighton, with a mean age of 15.5 years (SD=.31).  Many had
spelling problems, and subjects were in the middle and bottom bands of

                                                               Page 26


the fourth form.  Testing took place during the last two months of the
school year, and subjects were among the oldest pupils in  the  school
expecting to leave during the following year.  The head of the English
department of the school chose  subjects  who  had  both  reading  and
spelling difficulty of varying degrees.  Twelve of the poorest readers
were in a remedial class and the other subjects  were  in  the  middle
band.  All the subjects' IQs were in the normal range, ie 85 or above,
and vision and hearing were normal.  Motivation to participate in  the
study was high on the part of both pupils and teachers.'

     'The adult literacy sample consisted of  six  men  who  had  been
receiving  help  with  their reading and spelling through the Brighton
Adult Literacy Campaign.  The organizers of the scheme requested  that
permission  for  testing  be  acquired  from  both the student and his
tutor.  ...  One subject was in his  early  twenties,  three  were  in
their thirties, one was in his early forties and one was 58 years old.
Once subjects overcame their initial trepidation at being placed in  a
testing situation, motivation to participate was high.'

     In PERIN1.DAT, the 36 school students are numbered 01 to 36,  and
the  six  adult-literacy  students  37  to 42.  The first part of each
student's results gives the misspellings they made on a  dictation  of
the following passage (an extract from a government booklet):

     'If you are aged 16-19 and unemployed you should  take  advantage
of  the  special training schemes run by the government for unemployed
young people.  Enquire at your local  Jobcentre  about  the  different
schemes available.  You can choose to work for an employer on the spot
to get experience of a particular type of job or you  can  work  on  a
special  project.   Or  you  may prefer to work in Community Industry.
There are also courses run to help you choose which kind of work suits
you  best and courses to train you for a particular job at operator or
semi-skilled level.'

     Each misspelling in PERIN1.DAT is given a number  to  show  which
word it relates to.  The words are numbered as follows:

     '1 If 2 you 3 are 4 aged 16-19 5 and 6 unemployed 7 you  8 should
9 take  10 advantage  11 of  12 the  13 special 14 training 15 schemes
16 run  17 by  18 the  19 government  20 for  21 unemployed   22 young
23 people.   24 Enquire  25 at  26 your 27 local 28 Jobcentre 29 about
30 the 31 different 32 schemes 33 available.  34 You 35 can  36 choose
37 to  38 work  39 for  40 an  41 employer  42 on 43 the 44 spot 45 to
46 get 47 experience 48 of 49 a  50 particular  51 type  52 of  53 job
54 or  55 you  56 can 57 work 58 on 59 a 60 special 61 project.  62 Or
63 you 64 may 65 prefer 66 to 67 work 68 in 69 Community  70 Industry.
71 There   72 are  73 also  74 courses  75 run  76 to  77 help  78 you
79 choose 80 which  81 kind  82 of  83 work  84 suits  85 you  86 best
87 and  88 courses  89 to  90 train  91 you  92 for 93 a 94 particular
95 job 96 at 97 operator 98 or 99 semi-skilled 100 level.'

     The students were tested individually, the school students during
time  allocated  for  English  lessons, the adult literacy students in
their own homes or in Dr Perin's home.  First, the  student  read  the
passage  aloud,  then  the  student  copied  the passage, and then the

                                                               Page 27


student wrote the passage to  dictation.   After  the  dictation,  the
student  was  asked to read what he had written, checking for spelling
errors, and was permitted to  make  alterations  if  he  wished.   The
misspellings  given  in  PERIN1.DAT  are  those  that  remained in the
students' writing after this proofreading.  Continuation  lines  begin
with  a  '+', and the list ends with a '!'.  A '#' means there were no
errors.

     The second part of each student's results (the part starting on a
new line that begins with a '$') gives the misspellings that were made
in a different test.  The  following  passage  was  read  out  by  the
experimenter:

     'There was a very big diamond, one of the biggest diamonds in the
world.   It  was  being  shown  in  a  museum.   The museum was always
crowded.  One day, there was a bomb scare.  Everyone had to leave  the
museum,  even the men guarding the diamond.  When the guards returned,
the diamond was gone.  It turned out that  thieves  pretending  to  be
bomb experts had stolen it.'

     The students were then told to  write  the  story  in  their  own
words,  changing  or elaborating it as much as they wished.  They were
told not to be too concerned about making  spelling  errors;  if  they
were unsure of their spelling, they should guess.

     The misspellings are listed followed  by  the  correct  spelling.
Errors  of  capitalisation  or punctuation were generally ignored.  If
the  spelling  contained  a  space,  the  space  is   underlined   (eg
'evry_body'  for  'everybody').   Continuation lines begin with a '+'.
The list ends with a '!'.  A '#' means there were no errors.

     The second file - PERIN2.DAT - contains misspellings  taken  from
the free writing of six adult-literacy students, as listed in Appendix
XVII of Dr Perin's thesis.  She describes this material as follows:

     'The writing from which these errors are  taken  was  done  in  a
number  of  creative  writing  sessions  in  adult  literacy  classes.
Students were greatly encouraged by their  teachers  to  write  freely
without  being  slowed down by concentrating on correct spelling.  ...
In the course of writing, subjects would guess at unfamiliar spellings
and  would  occasionally  ask  the  teacher  for  assistance.  ..  Six
students - three good readers (three men) and three poor readers  (two
men  and  one  woman)  -  agreed to contribute a few of their original
pieces  of  writing  for  this  analysis.   ...   The  students   were
approached after their pieces had all been written and therefore their
work was not influenced by knowing that it would be analyzed.'

     'When it was not completely self-evident from the error what  the
subject  had intended to write, he or she was asked to verify what the
intention had been.  This was done soon  after  the  pieces  had  been
written.   Repetitions  of  misspellings  were  not  included  in  the
analysis.  If there was more than one misspelling for a word, both are
indicated.   The errors were produced on between three and five pieces
of writing of various lengths.'

                                                               Page 28


     In PERIN2.DAT, '$1' indicates the start of  the  first  student's
errors,  and so on.  They are listed as in Dr Perin's appendix, namely
the correct spelling followed by the misspelling (this  is  the  other
way round from PERIN1.DAT).  Each student's list ends with a '!'.

     The third file - PERIN3.DAT - contains the misspellings made by a
sample  of  14-  and  15-year-olds  in five inner London comprehensive
schools in response to a spelling test.  The tests  were  administered
as  part of a screening procedure, to identify subjects for subsequent
experiments - see Dolores Perin, 'Phonemic segmentation and spelling',
British Journal of Psychology, 1983, Vol 74, pages 129-144.

     The children were tested in  class  by  their  English  teachers.
Each  test  word was read out, then given in a sentence, then read out
again.  The words were as follows:

 1 engine     11 awful      21 planted      31 problem
 2 climb      12 stomach    22 reporter     32 refreshment
 3 because    13 opposite   23 remind       33 extended
 4 built      14 special    24 chapter      34 visited
 5 laugh      15 gallery    25 driven       35 splendid
 6 curtain    16 scissors   26 pretend      36 ventilated
 7 traffic    17 scarcely   27 understand   37 magnificent
 8 juice      18 bicycle    28 remember     38 inconvenient
 9 poetry     19 initials   29 contented    39 establishing
10 southern   20 receipt    30 latest       40 unexpected

     PERIN3.DAT contains a one-in-four sample of the scripts collected
in  this  study.   Each child begins with a three-digit serial number.
Then follows a code for the school (A to E) and the child's sex (M,  F
or  ?   if  not  known).   Then  the  list  of  misspellings is given;
continuation lines begin with a '+' and the list ends with a  '!'.   A
'#'  means that the child made no errors.  A '..' for a spelling means
that the child made no attempt at this word.

     The material for these files was provided by Dr Margaret  Peters,
who  was,  until  1984, Tutor at the Cambridge Institute of Education.
It was collected in the course of a piece  of  research  conducted  in
Cambridge  in  the 1960's and described by Margaret Peters in her book
'Success in Spelling', published in 1970 by the Cambridge Institute of
Education, Shaftesbury Road, Cambridge CB2 2BX, (ISBN 9500202 3 0).

     In brief, Dr Peters administered a test to all the children (over
900  of  them)  in  the  second-year  junior classes (ie children born
between 1 Sept 54 and 31 Aug 55)  of  the  Cambridge  Local  Education
Authority,  in  July 1964 (so most of the children were aged nine when
they took this first test).  In  July  1965,  she  schools  again  and
administered  another  test  to the same children (by this time mostly
aged ten), and in July 1966, she tested the same children  yet  again.
These  three tests are described in her book, and it is the results of

these tests that constitute most of the material in PETERS1.DAT.

     In July 1970, Dr Peters visited the Cambridge  secondary  schools
and  gave a further test to those same children (by now aged 15 and in
their final year of compulsory education).  It is this  material  that
forms the basis of PETERS2.DAT.  (Pressure of work prevented Dr Peters
from analysing it herself.)

     The material for PETERS1.DAT was collected  by  first  drawing  a
systematic  random  sample of one-in-six of the scripts from the first
test.  This gave 156 scripts.  The scripts of these  156  children  on
the  second,  third  and  fourth (ie secondary school) tests were then
obtained.  (Some of them were missing, of course, since some  children
moved  out  of  the  area;  this applies particularly to the secondary
school scripts.) Some details about each  child  and  a  list  of  the
errors  they  made  on  all  the tests were then written out, and this
information was keyed into the computer.

     Each case begins with a '$'  followed  by  a  three-digit  serial
number.  Then comes the school code (A to S - see below for the list),
the sex (M or F) and an assessment of the  handwriting  on  the  first
script  (1  for  good  to  5 for bad); this assessment was made by the
people who transferred the errors from the scripts to clean sheets for
subsequent  keying-in.   Then  comes  an  L  (child was noted as being
left-handed) or a '-' (no note of this), a V (visual defect noted)  or
a  '-',  and an A (auditory defect noted) or a '-'; for example, 'L--'
means the child was noted (on the script)  as  being  left-handed  but
there was no note of visual or auditory defect.

     Next comes number of brothers, number of  sisters  and  order  in
family;  missing  information  is recorded as -.  For the order in the
family, 0 (nought) means the child was an only child, 1  means  he/she
was  the  eldest,  and  so  on.   These  three fields are separated by
commas, eg 0,1,2 (no brothers, one sister, I'm the younger).

     Then comes a code for the secondary school (A to Y - see  below),
then  the  child's  own  assessment  of  their spelling in answer to a
question about this in the secondary school test (1 = Yes it's good, 2
=  Middling,  3  =  No  it's  not  good) and then an assessment of the
handwriting on the fourth (ie the secondary  school)  script  -  again
made  by  the people who transferred the errors prior to keying-in.  A
'-' for these fields indicates  that  this  information  was  missing,
usually because there was no secondary school script for the child.

     The final two codes on the first line of each case  indicate  the
socio-economic  class  of  the child's family (A to E), as assessed by
the child's  primary-school  teacher  in  their  final  year,  and  an
assessment   of   the   child's   creative  writing,  again  by  their
primary-school teacher, the grades meaning:

A Very vivid and lively writing
B Interesting writing
C Writes adequately
D Writing dull and uninteresting
E Does not achieve written expression beyond very

  factual and simple level

As usual, a '-' indicates that the information was missing.

     Each child's spelling errors are then given.   They  are  grouped
into  eight sections - %1T (the spelling test part of the first test),
%1D (the dictation part of the first test), similarly  %2T,  %2D,  %3T
and  %3D,  then  %4T  (the  spelling test part of the secondary school
test) and %4W (the free-writing part of the secondary school test).

     The spelling test parts of  all  four  tests  consisted  of  some
section  of  the following.  The word was read out, then a sentence of
context, then the word again; the child had to  write  down  just  the
test word:

 1 ON  Will you put the kettle on?
 2 HOT  The water is hot.

     The following words were also sometimes used.  There is no record
of the context-sentences used for them:

81 accordance      91 surplus            101 exhibition
82 mechanical      92 exceptionally      102 affectionately

                                                               Page 33


     The spelling test part of the first test used words 1 to 40.  The
spelling  test part of the second test began at word 11; for the third
test it began at word 21 , and for the fourth (secondary school) test,
it  began  at  word  31.   Sometimes, if Dr Peters felt that the class
could easily cope with the earlier words, she skipped the  first  part
of  the  test.   This  is marked in PETERS1.DAT as, for instance, >30,
meaning that words up to and including 30 were omitted.  How  many  of
the  more difficult words were given varied somewhat from one class to
another.

     A '-' for a particular word in a child's results  indicates  that
this word was given as part of the test but this child made no attempt
to write it.  The errors are written entirely in  lower-case  letters,
though the children often wrote in a mixture of upper- and lower-case.
The children's handwriting was sometimes illegible; the people copying
out  the  errors  simply  made  the  best guess they could of what the
children had written.  A '-' for the whole test means that this script
is  missing  for  this child.  A '#' for the test means that the child
made no errors.  The end of the list of errors is marked by a '!'.

     After the spelling test, the children  were  given  a  dictation.
The  dictation  in  the  first  test  was  as  follows.  (Each word is
numbered so that one can tell, given  a  misspelling  in  PETERS1.DAT,
which word the child was trying to write.)

     '1 One 2 day, 3 as 4 I 5 was 6 walking 7 down 8 Bridge  9 Street,
10 I  11 heard  12 the  13 sound  14 of  15 trotting.   16 I 17 turned
18 and 19 saw 20 behind 21 me 22 the 23 shaggy 24 dark  25 hair  26 of
27 a  28 frightened  29 little 30 horse.  31 I 32 searched 33 in 34 my
35 pockets 36 for 37 an 38 apple 39 from 40 my 41 dinner 42 to 43 give
44 him.  '45 I 46 know 47 where 48 you 49 should 50 be,' 51 I 52 said.
53 So 54 I 55 removed 56 the 57 belt 58 of  59 my  60 raincoat  61 and
62 tied  63 it  64 around 65 his 66 neck 67 and 68 led 69 him 70 back.
71 I 72 opened 73 the 74 gate, 75 and  76 with  77 satisfaction  78 he
79 galloped  80 into 81 his 82 own 83 field.  84 I 85 was 86 certainly
87 very 88 happy 89 that 90 now 91 he 92 was 93 safe, 94 away  95 from
96 the 97 noisy 98 and 99 dangerous 100 traffic.'

     After this dictation, Dr Peters said 'I expect you would like  to
know  the little horse's name.  Well, first of all I will tell you his
mother's name.  I am going to show it to you for a very short time and
then  hide  it  and  ask you to write it from memory.' She then showed
them a card for four seconds with the word  FLAGRANCY  on  it.   (This
appears  in  this  section  of  PETERS1.DAT  as  word  101.)  Then she
continued 'Very few people know the pony's name, but I do.  I will let
you  into the secret, but you must not start writing till I say GO and
hold up your pencils when I say STOP.' She  then  showed  a  card  for
three  seconds with the word VAGABOND on it, and gave them ten seconds
to write it.  (This is word 102.)

     The dictation in the second test was as follows:

     '1 Late 2 one 3 night 4 my 5 friend 6 woke 7 me 8 saying '9 Would
10 you  11 enjoy  12 a 13 trial-run 14 in 15 my 16 new 17 helicopter?'
18 I  19 had  20 scarcely  21 scrambled  22 into  23 my   24 tracksuit

                                                               Page 34


25 before  26 we  27 were  28 away.   29 The  30 lights  31 of  32 the
33 city 34 glowed 35 beneath:  36 the 37 stars 38 above.  39 I  40 was
41 beginning  42 to  43 wonder  44 about 45 our 46 destination 47 when
48 I 49 caught 50 sight  51 of  52 the  53 spinning  54 knife  55 edge
56 and  57 the  58 surface  59 of 60 what 61 must 62 have 63 been 64 a
65 type 66 of 67 flying 68 saucer 69 whistling 70 round 71 us.   72 We
73 dodged 74 skilfully 75 to 76 avoid 77 an 78 accident.  79 To 80 our
81 relief, 82 the 83 spacecraft  84 regained  85 height  86 and  87 we
88 sank  89 down  90 to  91 earth  92 and 93 the 94 comfortable 95 bed
96 I 97 had 98 never 99 actually 100 left.'

     After the dictation, Dr Peters held up cards  for  three  seconds
each  with  these words on:  FRUIT (word 101), FIELD (word 102), LODGE
(word 103).  She then spoke these three words:  SUITABLE  (word  104),
BELIEF (word 105) and HEDGE (word 106).

     The dictation in the third test was as follows:

     '1 A  2 peculiar  3 shape  4 was   5 approaching   6 from   7 the
8 southern   9 valley.   10 Gradually  11 they  12 distinguished  13 a
14 recently 15 designed  16 aeroplane  17 circling  18 above.   19 The
20 machine   21 touched  22 down  23 with  24 precision  25 in  26 the
27 rough  28 mountainous  29 region  30 without  31 even   32 scraping
33 its  34 surface.   35 The 36 children 37 surrounded 38 the 39 pilot
40 who 41 explained 42 that 43 his 44 altimeter 45 and  46 temperature
47 gauge  48 were  49 damaged  50 and 51 he 52 was 53 anxious 54 about
55 increasing 56 altitude 57 in  58 these  59 freezing  60 conditions.
61 From  62 the 63 alpine 64 school 65 he 66 telephoned 67 his 68 base
69 requesting 70 spare 71 instruments 72 to 73 be 74 delivered  75 and
76 fitted   77 immediately.    78 The   79 children  80 viewed  81 the
82 repairs  83 with  84 enthusiasm,  85 especially   86 when   87 they
88 were   89 taken   90 in  91 groups  92 for  93 an  94 unforgettable
95 flight 96 before 97 the 98 pilot's 99 final 100 departure.'

     In  transferring  the  errors  from  the  dictations,  errors  of
punctuation were generally ignored, as were errors of word-division in
'raincoat', 'trial-run', 'spacecraft' and 'tracksuit'.  Uncrossed  t's
were  not  counted as errors, and inserted words were ignored, such as
'type of a flying  saucer'  for  'type  of  flying  saucer'.   If  the
misspelling  contained  a  space,  this  is marked by an underline, eg
'a_prochin' for 'approaching'.

     Some of the children's efforts were largely illegible, often with
phrases  missed  out,  so that it was not always possible to say which
words the child was trying to  write.   The  people  transferring  the
errors  simply  did the best they could.  No effort was made to record
which words were omitted, and errors  were  not  recorded  if  it  was
impossible to see which words in the dictation they corresponded to.

     There was no dictation in the  fourth  (secondary  school)  test.
Instead,  the  children  were  asked  to  write,  for  ten minutes, on
'Memories of my primary school'.  The errors from  these  compositions
are given in PETERS1.DAT in the section beginning %4W.  They are given
in the following form:

                                                               Page 35


misspelling   correct_spelling   some context

eg rember   remember   Also I * the boys there

The '*' in the context indicates where the misspelling  came.   As  in
the  dictations,  an  underline  in  the  misspelling  (or the correct
spelling) indicates a space, eg

any_way   anyway   we got caned *
infront   in_front   show people up * of others

Where it was not clear what word was intended,  the  correct  spelling
may be preceded by a '?'.  For example:

ctans   ?curtains   there were these *

Proper names were ignored except where  the  context  made  it  fairly
clear what the spelling should be; for instance, 'a boy called Lenard'
should probably be 'Leonard' but one cannot be sure,  whereas  'a  day
trip to Lester' seems almost certain to be 'Leicester'.

     If the context contained a misspelling,  the  misspelt  form  has
been recorded in the context.  For example:

assemberly   assembly   we had * ever morning
ever   every   we had assemberly * morning

     Errors of punctuation were generally ignored, including errors of
capitalisation  such  as  'mr  smith'  for  'Mr  Smith'  and misplaced
possessive apostrophes as in "teachers' name"  for  "teacher's  name".
Misspellings  including  apostrophes  were  included,  however, if the
child had produced quite the wrong form of the word, as  in  "memory's
of primary school".

     A '-'  indicates  that  this  section  was  missing,  and  a  '#'
indicates that there were no misspellings.  A '!' indicates the end of
the list.

     The file PETERS2.DAT is taken entirely from the secondary  school
material.   It  contains  misspellings  from  all the secondary school
scripts that were  left  after  the  ones  for  PETERS1.DAT  had  been
removed.

     Each case begins with a three-digit serial  number,  followed  by
the  child's  sex  (M, F or '?' for those cases where it was not clear
from the name).  Then comes a code for  the  school  (A  to  Y  -  see
below),  the  child's own assessment of his/her spelling (1 = Yes it's
good; 2 = Middling; 3 = No it's not good), and an  assessment  of  the
child's  handwriting  made  by  the  people who transferred the errors
(from 1 for good to 5 for bad).

     Following this, and on the same line, are misspellings  that  the
child  made  on words 31 to 40 (see above) of the spelling test.  (The
words are numbered 1 to 10, ie 'eye' is word  1  to  'beautiful'  word
10.)  In  the  few  cases  where  a  second  line  is needed for these

                                                               Page 36


misspellings, the second line begins with a  '+'.   A  '#'  means  the
child got all 10 words right.  A '..' for a particular word means that
the child made no attempt at it.

     Then follow the misspellings from the free  writing,  transferred
in  the  manner  described  above.   Each of these lines begins with a
space.  A '#' means there were no misspellings in the free writing.

     The schools are identified by letters as follows:

1) Primary

A  Arbury         B  Brunswick       C  Milton Road
D  Priory         E  Queen Edith's   F  Romsey

SUPPLEMENT  March 1985

     A few changes have been made since the files, as described above,
were  submitted  to the Oxford Text Archive.  Some alterations, mostly
additions of errors-containing-spaces, have been made to  PETERS2.DAT.
This   was  necessary  because  it  was  found  that  the  people  who
transferred the errors from the scripts, who did different sections of
the  file,  had  treated  errors  of this type differently.  The other
change is the creation of PETERS1A.DAT.  This  is  a  list  of  errors
concerned  with  apostrophes  taken from the 4W scripts of the PETERS1
sample.  The errors are written in the form wrong-version followed  by
right-version.    A  '*'  means  that  the  composition  contained  no
apostrophes or places for apostrophes; a '#'  means  that  there  were
some places for apostrophes (one or more) and they were all correct.

     SHEFFIELD.DAT contains 384 misspellings,  mostly  typing  errors,
derived  from  either typewritten or terminal input and collected from
the staff and students of the Department of Information Studies at the
University  of  Sheffield as part of a piece of research into spelling
correction.  The work is described in 'Automatic  spelling  correction
using  a  trigram similarity measure' by Richard C.  Angell, George E.
Freund and Peter Willett, Information Processing and  Management,  Vol
19  No 4, 1983, pages 255-261.  The correct spelling is in "columns" 1
to 20, the misspelling in 21 to 40, all in upper case.

     This file was supplied by  Christopher  Upward  of  the  Dept  of
Modern  Languages, Aston University and is described in an unpublished
paper entitled 'Patterns of spelling mistake  in  traditional  English
Orthography'.  Mr Upward's address (1985) is:

       Department of Modern Languages,

       Birmingham B4 7ET

     In his paper, Mr Upward gives the following introduction  to  the
material:

'The following observations derive from analysis of 163 questionnaires
completed  by  a  cross-section of fourth-year pupils (average age 15,
50%  of  each  sex)  at  a  Nottingham  comprehensive   school.    The
questionnaires  were  originally  completed  as  part  of  a survey of
teenage attitudes conducted by Cyril Simmons, Lecturer in Education at
Loughborough  University  of Technology, using the unfinished sentence
technique.  Since they were anonymous and not designed to  elicit  any
linguistic  information,  the  linguistic  data  they  provide  has  a
spontaneous,  natural  quality,  free  from  the  possible  distorting
effects of tests explicitly conducted for linguistic purposes.

'The aim of the analysis was  to  establish  the  commonest  types  of
spelling  mistake and their approximate relative frequency.  Numerical
assessment of the  data  is  necessarily  rather  imprecise,  for  the
following  reasons:   concentration of illegible words in answers from
the least  literate  respondents  probably  led  to  non-recording  of
mistakes  in such cases; apparent slips of the pen were counted or not
counted as spelling mistakes at  the  assessor's  discretion;  ...   ;
errors  repeated  by  the  same  respondent were normally counted only
once, with the result that consistent errors,  occasional  errors  and
once-only  errors  were  not  distinguished  numerically; on the other
hand, varied misspellings of the same word by the same respondent were
separately  recorded;  ...   Figures  for  error  frequency  therefore
indicate not  the  number  or  proportion  of  occasions  on  which  a
particular  misspelling occurred, but the approximate number of pupils
out of 163 who were prone (however frequently or infrequently) to make
a given error (rather than to misspell a given word).

'Whatever  general  validity  the  results  may  have,  the  following
sociolinguistic  factors must be taken into account before generalised
conclusions are drawn:

1.  All the respondents belong to one age-group (15), and the patterns
of  error  they  demonstrate  cannot be assumed to be typical of, say,
primary school pupils or mature adults.

2.  The respondents were all resident in a suburb  of  Nottingham  and
attended the same comprehensive school.  Certain lexical peculiarities
of the area are evident; it is probable that some  errors  echo  local
pronunciation, and some replies indicate non-native ethnic origins.

3.  The sentences  the  respondents  were  invited  to  complete  were
designed  to  elicit  personal  opinions,  feelings  and attitudes; in
consequence the lexis is highly repetitive and restricted in range.

4.  The respondents were under no pressure to write  'correctly',  and
there  was  no  sign  of  conscious  attention  to  the formalities of
sentence structure, punctuation or use of the upper case; in fact many
answers  had  the  flavour  of  verbatim  transcription of an informal
spoken monologue, rather than of prose composition.'

     In  his  paper,  Mr  Upward  presents  the  errors   in   various
categories.   In  UPWARD.DAT,  however, they are all in one long list.
Each line contains the correct  spelling,  followed  by  one  or  more
misspellings  of  that word.  The numbers, as explained above, are the
number of respondents who made that error at least  once.   Where  the
correct  version  or the error contained a space, this is marked by an
underline, eg 'million_air'.

     This file is the one described and published in 'Spelling  errors
in  handwriting:   a  corpus and a distributional analysis' by Alan M.
Wing and Alan D.  Baddeley, published in the book 'Cognitive Processes
in Spelling', edited by Uta Frith, Academic Press 1980, pages 251-285.
The following are extracts from that paper:

     'The errors ..  were all those found in the exam scripts of forty
male,  secondary  school candidates applying for entrance to Cambridge
colleges in engineering, mathematics or natural  sciences.   The  exam
was the General Paper of November 1976 and candidates were required to
give essay-type answers to three self-selected questions.  These  were
marked  by  the  examiners  in  terms  of  the  candidates' ability to
formulate cogent  arguments  and  to  express  themselves  clearly  in
written   English.    Three   hours   were  allowed  for  writing  the
examination.

     'After the scripts were no  longer  required  by  the  examiners,
forty  were  selected  at  random.   A small proportion of the scripts
where there was reason to suspect that the candidates did not  possess
British English as first language were excluded.  ...

     'Each script was scrutinised for errors  by  two  people  working
independently.   ...   In  searching  for  errors the scrutineers were
instructed to record any word that deviated from the spelling  of  the
Oxford  Concise  English  Dictionary.   Apparent errors which could be
attributed to poor letter formation rather than wrong letters were not
included;  this  exclusion was particularly relevant to practices of a
shorthand  nature  such  as  contraction  of  'ing'  into  a  downward
squiggle.   A  deviation  was  recognised  even  if the error had been
corrected by the candidate.  In such cases the erroneous  version  was
recorded  as  the  sequence  of  letters  up to the point at which the
correction was made.

     'For every error, the scrutineer noted the target intended by the
candidate,  the  three  words  preceding the error and the three words
following the error.   ...   In  addition  ..   the  scrutineers  were
required  to  classify  each error as a slip or as a convention error.
An error was categorised as a slip  if  (a)  it  was  changed  to  the
correct  spelling  or (b) if uncorrected, the correct form of the word

                                                               Page 41


occurred at least once elsewhere in the script.  Otherwise  the  error
was  categorised  as a convention error.  [A 'convention error' is the
kind of error produced  by  someone  who  is  unsure  of  the  correct
spelling.  - RM.]

     'The two lists of errors for each script were checked against the
script  by  the  first author [Dr Wing] as he keyed them into magnetic
disc storage files on a computer.  A computer print-out of the  corpus
was  subsequently  given  to the scrutineer who had worked through the
majority of the scripts and she checked  it  for  errors  against  the
original scripts.

     ...

     In the file, the spelling errors are 'separated into two classes:
slips   (Type   1)  and  convention  errors  (Type  2).   Within  this
classification each candidate's errors (including targets and context)
are  grouped  together  in  the sequence in which they occurred in the
script.  For each error the erroneous form of the word is given  first
as  it  was  written up to the break in the written trace at which the
error was corrected, if a correction was attempted.  The  target  form
of the word is then given.  If shown in parentheses, no correction was
attempted by the candidate.

     'When the target for a Type 1  error  is  shown  misspelled  this
indicates  a  slip  was made in producing a Type 2 (convention) error.
The latter would thus also be listed under Type 2  errors  [unless  it
occurred elsewhere correctly spelled].  Some of the Type 2 targets not
in parentheses appear misspelled.  This  indicates  that  the  initial
misspelled  version  was changed, but to another incorrect form of the
word as shown.

     'The context comprises the three words written immediately before
the  error  and  the  three  words written immediately after the error
separated by a '*'.  In the context letters or  words  in  parentheses
indicate  items  in  the script deleted by the candidate.  Punctuation
marks are not indicated although sentence boundaries are  identifiable
by  the initial capital letter.  The abbreviations SQ and EQ stand for
start and end of the candidate's answer to a question.'




     The file WING.DAT differs slightly from the published version  of
the corpus.  The lines that begin each section (Type 1 and Type 2) and
the lines with the candidates' serial numbers now  all  begin  with  a
'$'.  Lines in the original file were a maximum of 65 characters long,
which made some of the contexts overrun onto a second line; each entry
now fits on one line - the longest is 91 characters.

     Users of this file should note the emphasis on handwriting slips.
Many  of  the error forms in the Type 1 section are fragments of words
rather than spelling errors in the ordinary sense.  For example, if  a
candidate  began  writing 'benefit' as 'bef' and then stopped, crossed
out the 'bef' and wrote 'benefit', this is recorded in the file as:

                                                               Page 42


bef benefit

If he did not correct it, but  indicated  that  he  knew  the  correct
spelling by writing it correctly elsewhere, this would appear as:

bef (benefit)

in the Type 1 section.  If he wrote 'bef' for 'benefit'  and  did  not
correct  it  and  did  not  write  it correctly elsewhere, it would be
counted as a convention error and appear in the Type 2 section.

     Users  should  also  note  that  the  'target',   when   not   in
parentheses,  is  the  letter-string  that  the  candidate intended to
write, not necessarily the correct spelling.  In fact, in some of  the
Type  2 errors, the candidate had already written the correct spelling
but changed it to a wrong spelling, thus giving rise to  entries  such
as:

acquire aquire

where 'acquire' (the 'error-form') is how it was before he 'corrected'
it and 'aquire' is the target - what he changed it to.

     This file consists of data supplied by Dr Rolf  Palmberg  and  Dr
Hakan Ringbom of the Abo Akademi, Finland.  Their addresses are:

Dr Rolf Palmberg,           Dr Hakan Ringbom,
Pedagogiska Fakulteten,     Engelska Institutionen,
Kyrkoesplanaden 12-14,      Fanriksgatan 3,
65100 Vasa 10,              20500 Abo 50,
Finland                     Finland

     The data consists  of  misspellings  of  English  words  made  by
Finnish-speaking  Finns  and  Swedish-speaking  Finns,  collected in a
series of tests conducted in the 1970s.

     Each section of  the  file  begins  with  a  line  beginning  '$'
followed by a few symbols:  V means Vasa, 1 means 1971 (2 1972, and so
on); C means Composition, G means  Grammar  and  Vocabulary,  T  means
Translation; F means Finnish-speakers and S means Swedish-speakers.

     The 'Vasa' material comes from tests given to first-year students
at  a  commercial  college  in Vasa, who had studied English for about
five years.  The test and the results are described in a paper by  Tom
Granfors and Rolf Palmberg, 'Errors made by Finns and Swedish-speaking
Finns learning English  at  commercial-college  level',  published  in
AFTIL 5, 1976, pages 14-53 (Abo Akademi).

     For the 'Composition', the  students  were  given  a  comic-strip
(without  words)  and were told the story in their own language.  They
then had to write the story in English.  The other Vasa sections  were
presumably taken from other tests given to the same group of students.

     The rest of the data comes  from  tests  given  as  part  of  the
entrance  test  to  the Department of English of the Abo Akademi.  The
candidates were fairly advanced students who had studied  English  for
7-8  years  and  had  already  achieved  a  high  mark in the national
matriculation examination in English.  Some of this data is  described
and  analysed  in  'Spelling  errors  and  foreign  language  learning
strategies' by Hakan Ringbom, published in 'Papers from the Conference
on  Contrastive  Linguistics  and  Error  Analysis',  ed  Palmberg and
Ringbom, Research Institute of the Abo  Akademi  Foundation,  Vol  19,

     In  the  file,  each  misspelling  is  followed  by  the  correct
spelling;  if  the misspelling occurred more than once in this section
of  the  data,  the  number  of  occurrences  is  given  next.    Some
clarification  may  then be given in square brackets.  If the error or
the correct spelling contained  a  space,  this  is  indicated  by  an
underline,  eg  'shot_gun'.  Each entry is terminated by a comma.  The
final entry in each section ends with a full-stop.

     The files APPLING1.DAT and APPLING2.DAT contain errors written by
foreign  learners  of English.  They were collected by students in the
Department of Applied Linguistics of Birkbeck College in the course of
their  work  as teachers of English.  The learners' command of English
varied  from  lower  to  upper  intermediate.   Each  learner's  first
language is recorded in the files on lines beginning with a '$'.

     APPLING1.DAT contains errors from free writing, in the format:

misspelling  correct_spelling  a few words of context

     APPLING2.DAT contains errors from dictations and a spelling test.
The  dictations  were  the  same  as the one used in the CHES (see the
description of the CHES file) and the one used in the NFER survey (see
the  description  of the NFER files).  The spelling test included some
of the words from the PETERS test, and some of those from PERIN3.

     Paul Meara helped to arrange  the  exercise,  and  the  following
students collected the data:

     The file BLOOR.DAT was supplied by Meriel Bloor of  the  Dept  of
Modern  Languages,  Language  Studies Unit, University of Aston, Gosta
Green, Birmingham B4 7ET.

     The list comes from a corpus of written English  by  12  Algerian
students  entering  an  English  Language course in Britain.  It forms
part of an error analysis exercise conducted by  some  students  on  a
Master's degree course.

     The Algerian students were Arabic speakers, but most of them  had
a  good knowledge of French which they had used for academic purposes.
They had  all  studied  English  in  secondary  school  as  a  foreign
language.  Their level of English was lower to middle intermediate.

     Each line of the file gives the correct spelling, then the number
of  students  who  misspelled  the  word (not the number of times they
misspelled it), then the misspelling(s) they made, sometimes  followed
by  the  co-text  in square brackets, in which a * indicates where the
word came.

     This  file  contains  spelling  errors  taken  from  compositions
written  in  English examinations by students in each of the following
countries:   Argentina,  Brunei,  Egypt,  France,   Germany,   Greece,
Holland,  Italy,  Jamaica, Japan, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, Portugal,
Singapore, Spain, Sweden and Zimbabwe - a total of eighteen countries.
(Jamaica  was  included  because  the  data  happened to be available,
though English is not as foreign a language to Jamaicans as it  is  to
natives of the other countries in the list.)

     Fifty or 100 scripts were taken from each country, generally from
three  or  four  examination centres in the country.  The examinations
were the Cambridge Overseas  School  Certificate  (Argentina,  Brunei,
Mauritius,  Singapore, Zimbabwe), the General Certificate of Education
'Ordinary'  level  (Egypt  and  Jamaica),  and  the  Cambridge   First
Certificate in English (all the rest).

     The  scripts  contained  no  explicit   information   about   the
candidates'  mother  tongues  but  the  great majority were presumably
natives of the country in which  they  were  taking  the  examination.
Candidates  were  not  included  if  it seemed likely, on the basis of
their names, that they had been born in another country.  For example,
a  person  with  an apparently Vietnamese name was eliminated from the
Norway file as was someone with a Portuguese name  from  the  Japanese
file.

     There is a  separate  section  for  each  country,  each  section
beginning  with the name of the country preceded by a "$" (eg $SPAIN).
Within each section, each script is assigned a  number  starting  with
001.   (These  numbers  do  not,  of  course, bear any relation to the
candidates' examination numbers.) In the case of Brunei and  Singapore
only,  C  or  M  after  the  number indicates that the candidate had a
Chinese or Malay name; this information  was  recorded  in  the  files
because  the  difference  of  mother  tongue might be reflected in the
kinds of errors made in English.

     Each error occupies a single line.  The standard layout is:

incorrect_spelling  correct_spelling

Where the incorrect spelling of word X happens to  correspond  to  the

                                                               Page 48


correct  spelling of another word, the context is usually given on the
right, with the misspelling replaced by a '*'.  For example:

brake  break  those who * the law

Alternatively, the word class of the intended word  is  given  between
square brackets, eg [v] verb, [n] noun, etc.  For example:

robe  rob [v]

Where the same error occurs two or more times within a script,  it  is
included  only  once but the number of repetitions is indicated on the
right, as in:

saied  said  4

     Errors  involving  incorrect  use  of  the  hyphen,  faulty  word
division,  etc.   are treated as spelling errors.  Space between words
is indicated by an underline.  Examples:

broom_thick  broomstick  as thin as a *
old_fashioned  old-fashioned
welknown  well-known

     Where British and U.S. spelling conventions differ,  British  has
been  taken as correct.  It may be that in several of these countries,
most notably those of central and South America,  U.S. spelling  might
be  considered  more  'correct'  than  British; on the other hand, the
examinations were being administered by British examination boards.

     Sometimes there is no single word to which the error corresponds;
the student has either written an inappropriate word or has invented a
word that doesn't exist.  Though these are not really spelling errors,
they  have  sometimes  been  included.   A  00  is put in place of the
correct word, and an interpretation given in square brackets, as in:

no  00 ["any"]  hardly * turists

spectacularity  00 ["spectacular event"]

     Note that, where an incorrectly spelt word occurs as part of  the
context  for  another  word,  it is quoted as written, as is "turists"
here.

     Where it is  not  clear  what  word  was  intended,  the  correct
spelling  may  be  preceded by a question mark; occasionally, there is
only a question mark, indicating that no  reasonable  guess  could  be
made.

     In the scripts of several countries, notably  Brunei,  Mauritius,
Singapore  and  Zimbabwe,  certain  kinds of error occurred with great
regularity.  For example, verbs were frequently not  marked  for  past
and  nouns  in  the plural often lacked final -s.  Since there were so
many of these, and since they were perhaps errors  of  grammar  rather
than  of  spelling, they were generally recorded only in the first two

                                                               Page 49


or three  scripts  from  a  country  and  ignored  in  the  remainder.
Somewhat  similar  was the addition of plural endings to adjectives in
some scripts from Spanish and French speaking students  (as  in  "bigs
houses").   Where  such  errors  occurred  with  great  frequency in a
particular script, only the first few were recorded.  One error  found
in all eighteen countries was the use of "people" with a singular verb
- "people says".  For each  country,  only  the  first  two  or  three
examples of this error were recorded.

     The  scripts  were  made  available  for  this  exercise  by  the
University   of   Cambridge   Local  Examinations  Syndicate  and  the
University  of  London  Schools  Examinations  Board.   The  task   of
extracting  the  errors  from  the  scripts  and  keying them into the
computer was carried out by Philip Baker.

     SUOMI.DAT contains the data from an  M.A.   thesis  submitted  by
Riitta  Suomi  at  the  Abo  Akademi,  Finland,  1984.   The thesis is
entitled 'Spelling errors and interference errors in English  made  by
Finns  and  Swedish-speaking  Finns  in  the 9th form of comprehensive
school'.

     The errors were taken from test  papers  written  by  60  Finnish
speakers  and  45  Swedish speakers, aged 15-16 years, who had had 6-7
years of English at school.  They did  about  16  hours  per  week  of
English.  The students are divided into F1 (30 Finnish students in the
'extensive set' - I think this means a more advanced  class),  F2  (30
Finnish  students in the 'intermediate set'), S1 (30 Swedish-speaking,
extensive set) and S2 (15 Swedish-speaking, comprising 7  intermediate
and 8 others).

     The errors were taken from two tests (T1, taken by groups  1  and
2,  and  T2,  taken  by  group  1  only).   The tests were part of the
nationwide general proficiency test in English from 1981.

     The first test consisted of short dialogues written  in  English,
with  some  parts  in  the  students'  own  language,  with gaps.  The
students read these dialogues  and  wrote  the  appropriate  words  or
sentences of English in the gaps.  The following is one of them:

'It is April and Meg wants to buy a pair of new shoes.
She goes to a department store.
Assistant: "Good morning.  May I help you?"
Meg: "............................................."
     Jag skulle vilja ha ett par lagklackade skor.
Assistant: "Shoes with low heels are over there.
            These brown ones are very nice."
Meg: "............................................."
      Jag tycker inte om den har fargen.
Assistant:  "We also have them in blue."
Meg:  "They look nice.  ..........................."
                        Far jag prova dem?
Assistant:  "Of course.  Do they fit?"
Meg:  "Yes, I like them.  I'll take them.
      ..................................."
      Var kan jag betala?

Assistant:  "Over there at the cash desk."

     The second test consisted of a series of 'mini-dialogues',  which
were  read  out  in  English.  Each was read out twice, the first time
straight through and the second time with questions (in the  students'
own language) to which the students had to write answers.  This is one
of them, followed by the questions:

A:  Would you like some cheese-pie?  I just made one.

S:  Thank you, yes I'd love a piece of it.  Oh, how
    delicious.  Can I have another slice?  How do you
    make it?  Could I please have the recipe?

A:  Yes, it's quite easy.  All you need is flour,
    butter, salt, pepper, cold water, one large onion,
    eggs, milk, bacon, tomatoes, and cheese of course.
    I'll write it down for you.

S:  How kind of you.  I'll try it next week.  We're
    going to have a party.

Why did Susan ask for the recipe?
What do you need to make a cheese pie? (Mention at
least four things.)

     The line in the file $F1T1 marks the section of errors  from  the
Finnish-speakers,  group  1 on test 1, and so on.  The errors are then
presented, with the error first followed by the correct spelling.  The
pair  may be followed by a number, indicating that this error occurred
more than once in this section.  Each entry ends with a comma, and the
last  entry  in  each section ends with a full-stop.  Errors involving
only capitalisation, such as 'i' for  'I',  have  not  been  included.
Where  the  error or the correct word contains a space, this is marked
as an underline, eg 'excuse_me'.

     The data in TELEMARK.DAT is taken from a study by Nils Rottingen,
entitled  'A  typology  of grammatical and orthographic errors made by
advanced  Norwegian  learners  of  English  as  a  foreign  language',
published by Telemark College, N-3800 Bo, Norway (ISBN 82-7206-095-7).

     The errors were taken from 290 examination papers written by  145
students  in  the spring of 1974, '75, '76 and '77.  The students were
first-year Norwegian college students of English, ranging in age  from
18  to  55,  who  had  studied  English  for  at least four years upon
entering the college.  The students had to write two essays; they  had
ample time to complete them and they were strongly recommended to make
their English as correct as they could.

     All the errors recorded in Appendix 1 of  Dr  Rottingen's  report
have been keyed into the file, except those involving only apostrophes
or capital letters.  Each line has one  error,  with  the  misspelling
first  followed  by  the  correct  spelling.   If a number follows the
correct spelling, this indicates how often this  misspelling  occurred
in  the  corpus; if no number follows the correct spelling, this means
that the misspelling occurred just once.  If the  misspelling  or  the
correct  spelling  contains a space, this is underlined, eg "in_stead"
for "instead".

     The keying-in  was  done  by  the  Data  Preparation  Service  of
Birkbeck College.

     The data in TESDELL.DAT was supplied by Mr Lee S.  Tesdell, whose
current  (1984)  address  is  Box  144, UPM 843, Dhahran International
Airport, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.  The  study  in  which  the  data  was
collected  is  rep  TESOL  Quarterly,  Vol  18, No 2, June 1984, pages
333-4.  The following is taken from that paper:

     'This study investigated spelling errors in compositions  written
by  students  from  four  different language backgrounds at Iowa State
University.  Fifty-six writing  samples  were  collected:   nine  from
Arabic   speakers,  ten  from  Chinese  speakers,  twenty  from  Malay
speakers, and seventeen from Spanish speakers.  All  of  the  students
had  scored 80-90 (inclusive) on the Michigan Test of English Language
Proficiency and all had achieved a minimum of 500 on the TOEFL.   They
were  all  enrolled  in  academic  programs  at  Iowa State during the
1981-1982 school year.'

     In TESDELL.DAT, each  student  begins  with  a  two-digit  serial
number, followed by A (Arabic), C (Chinese), M (Malay) or S (Spanish).
Then follows the the number of words in the student's composition, and
then  the  student's  score  on  the Michigan Test of English Language
Proficiency.

     All the student's misspellings are then listed, each followed  by
the  correct  spelling; the same mistake may be listed more than once,
indicating that the student made this mistake more than once.  No line
exceeds  80  characters, and continuation lines begin with a +.  Where
Tesdell could not guess what word was intended, there is a ?  in place
of  the  correct  spelling;  where  he  was not sure of his guess, the
correct spelling is preceded by a ?.  Where there is a  space  in  the
spelling, this is underlined, eg 'per_capita'.  A # indicates that the
student made no spelling errors.

     British users of this material should note that, since  the  work
was  carried  out  at  Iowa  State University, 'correct spelling' here
means  'correct  American  spelling',   so   a   number   of   correct
British-English spellings are here counted as errors, such as 'plough'
and 'aeroplanes'.
