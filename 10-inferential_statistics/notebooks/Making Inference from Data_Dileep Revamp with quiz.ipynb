    "**Estimates first!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that standard deviation for population is denoted by  $\\sigma$  while the sample standard deviation is given by  $s = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt {n}}$ . This sample standard deviation s is said to be an estimate of the population standard deviation  $\\sigma$  and can be used as a substitute for the same in case we don't know  $\\sigma$ . You will learn more about **estimates** in the next topic. Similarly the sample mean ( $\\bar x$ ) can be considered as an estimate of the population mean ( $\\mu$ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is degree of freedom and how is it related to estimates?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some estimates are based on more information than others. For example, an estimate of the variance based on a sample size of  $200$  is based on more information than an estimate of the variance based on a sample size of  $10$ . The concept of degrees of freedom is central to the principle of estimating statistics of populations from samples of them. Degrees of freedom is commonly abbreviated to `df`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of `df` as a mathematical restriction that needs to be put in place when estimating one statistic from an estimate of another. **The degrees of freedom (`df`) of an estimate is the number of independent pieces of information on which the estimate is based**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples calculating degree of freedom**\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's say that you know that the mean height of all the employees at your company is 6 feet and wish to estimate the variance of their heights. Lets consider separate instances and look at the outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case I**: We randomly sample one employee out of all and find that the employee's height is 8 feet. Recall that the variance is defined as the mean squared deviation of the values from their population mean. We can compute the squared deviation of our value of 8 from the population mean of 6 to find a single squared deviation from the mean. This single squared deviation from the mean,   $(8-6)^2 = 4$  , is an estimate of the mean squared deviation for all the employees. Therefore, based on this sample of one, we would estimate that the population variance is 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "  **Since this estimate is based on a single piece of information, therefore it has 1 `df`**. If we sampled another employee and obtained a height of 5 feet, then we could compute a second estimate of the variance,  $(5-6)^2 = 1$ . We could then average our two estimates (4 and 1) to obtain an estimate of 2.5. **Since this estimate is based on two independent pieces of information, it has two degrees of freedom**. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  *NOTE*: **The two estimates are independent because they are based on two independently and randomly selected employees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case II**: Usually it is pretty rare that we know the population mean when we are estimating the variance. Instead, we have to first estimate the population mean ( $\\mu$ ) with the sample mean ( $\\bar x$ ). The process of estimating the mean affects our degrees of freedom as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Returning to your problem of estimating the variance in the employee heights, let's assume you do not know the population mean ( $\\mu$ ) and therefore we have to estimate it from the sample mean ( $\\bar x$ ). You have sampled two employees and found that their heights are 8 and 5. Therefore $\\bar x$ , your estimate of the population mean, is  $\\bar x = (8+5)/2 = 6.5$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can now compute two estimates of variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\text{Estimate 1} = (8-6.5)^2 = 2.25$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\text{Estimate 2} = (5-6.5)^2 = 2.25$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Are these two estimates independent?** The answer is **`NO`** because each height contributed to the calculation of  $\\bar x$ . Since the first employee's height of 8 influenced  $\\bar x$ , it also influenced Estimate 2. If the first height had been, for example, 10, then  $\\bar x$  would have been 7.5 and Estimate 2 would have been  $(5-7.5)^2 = 6.25$  instead of 2.25. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  The important point is that the two estimates are not independent and therefore we do not have two degrees of freedom. Another way to think about the non-independence is to consider that if you knew the mean and one of the scores, you would know the other score. For example, if one score is 5 and the mean is 6.5, you can compute that the total of the two scores is 13 and therefore that the other score must be  $13-5 = 8$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In general, the degrees of freedom for an estimate is equal to the number of values minus the number of parameters estimated en route to the estimate in question**. In the employees example, there are two values (8 and 5) and we had to estimate one parameter ( $\\mu$ ) on the way to estimating the parameter of interest ( $\\sigma$ ). Therefore, the estimate of variance has  $2 - 1 = 1$  degree of freedom. If we had sampled 12 employees instead, then our estimate of variance would have had 11 degrees of freedom. Therefore, the degrees of freedom of an estimate of variance is equal to $n-1$ , where n is the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is the reason why the denominator while calculating sample variance is  $n-1$  instead of n so that it provides an unbiased estimator. \n",

    "Probability theory does more than this; it actually gives an explanation why  $\\bar x$  is a good choice as point estimator for  $\\mu$ . You already know from the section on **Central Limit Theorem** that as long as a sample is taken at random, the distribution of sample means is exactly centered at the value of population mean. \n",

Any particular sample mean ( $\\bar x_i$ ) might turn out to be less than the actual population mean ( $\\mu$ ), or it might turn out to be more. But in the long run, such sample means are *on target* in that they will not underestimate any more or less often than they overestimate. Hence  $\\bar x$  can be considered as what we term as an unbiased estimator of the population mean  $\\mu$  under the condition that the samples are drawn at random.\n",

    "This completes out first step where based on the problem statement we have stated our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Formulate the plan for analysis\n",
    "Based on the hypothesis that we have stated in the previous step now we need to determine a plan to make our decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we need to determine is the test statistic that we will be calculating for our data. We can determine this test statistic based on what population parameter we are testing. In our example we want to check the **average** amount of coffee filled by the machine. For such cases we use a `z-statistic` calculated as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " $n - sample \\ size$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a look at different types of test statistics is later topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Analyze sample data\n",
    "Now that we have decided upon which test statistic to use, we need to calculate the value for the same based on the information that we have regarding the sample and the population. From the example given above we can clearly write the information as follows\n",
    "\n",
    " $population \\ mean = \\mu = 200gms$ \n",
    "\n",
    " $population \\ standard \\ deviation = \\sigma = 4gms$ \n",
    "\n",
    " $sample \\ size = n = 25$ \n",
    "\n",
    " $sample \\ mean = \\bar{x} = 202gms$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have all the information that we need to caluculate our test statistic.\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} =\\frac{202 - 200}{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{25}}}  = 2.5$$\n",
    ". \n",
    "### 4. Interpreting the result\n",
    "This is one of the most critical steps in hypothesis testing. Based on the test statistic that we have calculate in the previous step we need to make a decision regarding our hypothesis. As stated in the earlier topic we are looking for an evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In this step we will be calculating a`p-value` based on which we will be interpreting the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now `p-value` is quite misunderstood by a lot of people. Before proceeding further, let's go through a video explaining it through a simple example - [p-values made easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jW9G8MO4PQ).\n",
    "With the intuitive understanding in the background, let's do a more technical deep dive - [p-values clearly explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z9OIYA8He8). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `p-value`, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis ( $H_0$ ) of a study question is true – the definition of ‘extreme’ depends on how the hypothesis is being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example `p-value` is the probability of finding the average coffee filled to be 202 grams when the null hypothesis is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if `p-value` is very small then we can safely say the there is a **strong evidence against** the null hypothesis whereas on the flipside if `p-value` is large we can say that there is **weak evidence against** the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the question is how do we calculate this `p-value`. From the central limit theorem we are aware from the Cental Limit Theorem that the sampling distribution of sample means is normally distributed. As we are dealing with samples in this case, we can use a normal distribution to calculate the `p-value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we can calculate the `p-value` as follows\n",
    "\n",
    " $p-value = P(z \\geq 2.5) = 0.0062$  (remmember the calculation from probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know that the probability of finding a average of 202 grams is 0.0062 when the null hypothesis is true. As you can observe this is a very small probability, but we need some threshold to define what probability is small or big. This threshold is called as significance level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of significance level at which you reject H0 is arbitrary. Conventionally the 5% (less than 1 in 20 chance of being wrong), 1% and 0.1% (p < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001) levels have been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for our example we select level of significance of 5% i.e. 0.05. As our calculated p-value is less than the threshold we can say that there is strong evidence against the Null Hypothesis and hence we reject the null hypothesis in favour of alternate hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion: From out test of hypothesis we can say that the average amount of coffee filled by the machine is significantly different that 200 grams and hence some action is warranted**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as you are well versed with the process of hypothesis testing we will apply the test to some of our hypothesis to the housing dataset in the next topic. We will use the python library of `statsmodels` to perform this testing.\n"

    "\n",
    "The chi-squared test of independence is used when you have two categorical variables from the same population. The test of independence is used to determine whether the two categorical variables are inter-related to each other.\n",

    "Many a times it would occur that the features in a dataset are related to each other, such features do not add much information while building a machine learning model and it is best to remove one of these related feature. Chi-squared test of independence is one of the ways to determine this.\n",
