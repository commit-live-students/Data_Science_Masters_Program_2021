    "\n",
    "**Intuition for Linear regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with what information we have: The main goal is to build a machine learning model which can predict the selling price of the house given some its features like `GrLivArea`, `Garage Area` etc. If you do a scatter plot our data with `SalePrice` which is the target variable and `GrLivArea`, a feature of the house, we might get something similar to the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Know Your Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple linear regression, we establish a relationship between target variable and input variables by fitting a line, known as the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a line can be represented by linear equation $y = mx + b$. Where, $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $m$ is the slope, $b$ is the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we rewrite our equation as $y(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x$ where $\\theta_i$s are the parameters of the model, $x$ is the input, and $y$ is the target variable. This is the standard notation in machine learning, and makes it easier to add more dimensions. We can simply add variables $\\theta_2, \\theta_3, ..., \\theta_n$ and $x_2, x_3, ...$ as we add more dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Different values of $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ will give us different lines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the values of the parameters determine what predictions the model will make. For example, let's consider $(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = (0.0, 0.2)$, and the first data point, where $x = 3456$ and $y_{true} = 600$. The prediction made by the model, $y(x) = 0.0 + 0.2*3456 = 691.2$. If instead the weights were $(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = (80.0, 0.15)$, then the prediction would be $y(x) = 80.0 + 0.15*3456 = 598.4$, which is much closer to the $y_{true} = 600$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference between the actual value of the target and the predicted value is called the **residual**. You should always select the line with the least residual as the line fits the data points appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Linear Regression for this data**\n",
    "\n",
    "We observed linear relationship between the features to the price of the house (which is a continuous real valued number), so, it is a regression task. So, `Linear Regression` will do a good job in predicting our target i.e. **Sale Price**. \n",

Well, multicollinearity occurs when **independent variables in a regression model are correlated**. This correlation is a problem because independent variables should be independent.

However, when independent variables are correlated, changes in one variable in turn shifts another variable/variables. The stronger the correlation, the more difficult it is to change one variable without changing another.

Instead it uses the mean of the observed responses of dependent variable $Y$ and always predicts this mean as the value of $Y$.\n",
