    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s continue solving the same problem we encountered in the regression modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have with us the complete [`Iowa housing dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset describes the properties of a single house as well as the amount it was sold for.The data set contains 81 features and 1300 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply simple Linear Regression model on it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Data Loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data Split\n",
    "\n",
    "model=LinearRegression()\n",

    "We get `(r2_score)` as `0.66`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Knowing this score to be low, we apply **one Feature Selection technique** and we get a `subset` of 30 features.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "After subsetting the data to incorporate only those 30 features, we apply Linear Regression model \n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Data Loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "#Feature Selection method applied to dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the ML process of finding the subset of features that are most relevant for a `better` predictive model.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection methods can help identify as well as remove redundant and irrelevant attributes from data that do not contribute to the predictive power of the model.\n",

    "The objective of feature selection is three-fold: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improving the prediction performance of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Providing faster and more cost-effective predictors.\n",

    "***\n",
    "**Embedded method is a type of filter method because:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure of feature selection can be understood as adding a penalty to reduce the degree of overfitting. This results in weights of features become very small(or 0),therefore filtering out unnecessary features.\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedded method is a type of wrapper method because:**\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded methods usually achieve high accuracy characteristic to wrapper methods and high efficiency characteristic to filter methods\n",

    "**Lasso (L1):** It stands for *Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator* and adds **absolute value of magnitude of coefficient** as penalty term to the loss function. Mathematically, the new regularized cost function becomes:  $$J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x_i)-y_i)^2 + \\lambda\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|\\theta_i|$$ \n",

    "**5.2 Definition** \n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis or PCA is the method of transforming original variables into a new set of variables such that they are orthogonal (and hence linearly independent) and then ranking according to the variance of data along them. These newly extracted variables are called Principal Components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal components are extracted in such a way that the first principal component explains maximum variance in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second principal component(uncorrelated to the first) tries to explain the remaining variance(not explained by the first).\n",
    "\n",
    "Third principal component explains the variance not explained by first and second and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.3 Working of PCA**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the working of PCA, it's important for you to have a knowledge of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. You can refresh the concept here(link to be pasted).\n",
    "\n",
    "Follwing are its steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:\n",
    "Calculate covariance of matrix X(Feature matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2:\n",
    "Calculate eigen vectors and corresponding eigen values of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3:\n",
    "Sort the eigen vectors according to their eigen value (in decreasing order).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4:\n",
    "Use Eigenvectors corresponding to the (k)largest eigenvalues to reconstruct a large fraction of variance of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand the steps better using an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Consider a sample of our IOWA housing dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It has 80 features and one target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the first step, let's scale the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "**Q:** Why do we need to scale it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** The end result of PCA is to calculate a new projection of your data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in many other multivariate procedures one needs to ensure that no extra weight is given to the “larger” variables which otherwise will lead to biased outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For eg:\n",
    "In the event we decide to change the scale of one of the features from metres to cm, the resulting variance of the feature would be 100 times more than it previously was. This would result in that feature playing a major role deciding the first PC since the PCA algorithm would be biased towards this new feature, in order to maximize its variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling the data, all variables will have the same standard deviation, thus none of the variables will have any bias and PCA can calculate relevant axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "After scaling, our first row of feature matrix will look something like:\n",

    "The reason there exists so many methods is that there is no single feature selection method that will give best results across all Machine Learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the most of the methods mentioned here, the user should know what kind will work best for him given the domain, data and the problem he is trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at some point, you are too confused to decide what to use, following is a checklist you can refer to, to help you ease up the feature selection process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection Check list:**\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you have domain knowledge?` If yes, construct a better set of “ad hoc” features that will provide more information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Are your features all of the same scale?` If no, consider normalizing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you suspect interdependence of features?` If yes, expand your feature set by constructing products of features, as much as your computer resources allow \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you need to reduce the count of input variables (e.g. for cost, speed or data understanding reasons)?` If no, then construct disjunctive features or weighted sums of features \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  `Do you need to assess features individually (e.g. to understand their influence on the systemor because their number is so large that you need to do a first filtering)? `If yes, use a variable ranking method ; else, do it anyway to get baseline results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you need a predictor?` If no, stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you suspect your data is “dirty” (has a few meaningless input patterns and/or noisyoutputs or wrong class labels)? `If yes, detect the outlier examples using the top ranking variables as representation; check and/or discard them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you know what to try first?` If no, use a linear predictor. Construct a sequence of predictors of same nature using increasing subsets of features. Can you match or improve performance with a smaller subset? If yes, try a non-linear predictor with that subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you have new ideas, time, computational resources, and enough examples?` If yes, compare several feature selection methods, including your new idea, correlation coefficients, backward selection and embedded methods . Use linear and non-linear predictors. Select the best approach with model selection .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Do you want a stable solution (to improve performance and/or understanding)?` If yes, subsample your data and redo your analysis for several “subsets” \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
